 There's a brand new way to build AI agents and add them to your website. This platform called Chatbase lets you create a chatbot for your website. It could be powered by ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Claude. But now they have a brand new option called Actions. These are little agents that could do tasks automatically for you. So for example, when someone's talking to your chatbot, this new agent could collect leads for you directly on the chatbox. This other agent could book appointments and it will actually use Calendly. It will check your calendar to make sure there are no conflicts and automatically book the appointment for you. And they have an agent that could actually search the web for up-to-date information along with your own knowledge base too. And if you haven't used Chatbase before, it's an AI chatbot builder where you give it literally your entire knowledge base and it will be able to use that knowledge base every time a customer talks to it inside of your website. And now it has all these AI agent capabilities too.
