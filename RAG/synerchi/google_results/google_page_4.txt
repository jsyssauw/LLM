Get To Know Us
SynerChi is Irelandâs original Kombucha brewery. Laura Murphy our founder and âbrew masterâ established the first traditional kombucha tea microbrewery or âKombreweryâ in Ireland, when SynerChi Kombucha started life in Stoneybatter Dublin back in 2012. Raymond Coyle founder of Tayto Park and previously of Largo Foods Tayto Crisps brand, came on board as our investor in 2013.
SynerChi is made using a traditional fermentation method so that the live cultures and naturally occurring raw enzymes are preserved. Made by fermenting organic teas with a live kombucha culture of yeast and bacteria, producing a deliciously refreshing brew.
The first documented use of kombucha tea was during the Chinese in Dynasty in 221 B.C. Originating in East Asia, kombucha is known for being an ancient âhealth drinkâ even referred to as âMiracle teaâ believed to be a potent source of Chi, the Chinese word for âinner energyâ¦ the invigorating life force!â Over millennia, people have continued to use live cultured foods and drinks to improve health holistically and promote longevity.
SynerChi Kombucha offers an authentically craft-brewed alternative to regular soft drinks that is full of live cultures, antioxidants and no nasties.
âIâm delighted to be supporting Irish and investing in a homegrown brand such as, SynerChi. I believe Kombucha to be a product in the food healthÂ sector that is going to go from strength to strength as Irish consumers appreciate and value its health credentials. I look forward to working with the SynerChi team on some exciting new product lines which I believe will help the brand become a household nameâ.
Speaking of the launch, Investor, Raymond Coyle
