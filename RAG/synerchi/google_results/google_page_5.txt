Frequently asked questions
What is kombucha?
Originating in Ancient China over 2000 years ago and known throughout the ages as âmiracle teaâ kombucha is a naturally fermented drink made from sweetened (antioxidant rich) green tea and a specific culture known as a âkombucha scobyâ.
Brimming with live cultures, raw enzymes and amino acids, it is this unique live culture (SCOBY) which brings the flavour and âfunctional' status to authentically brewed kombucha like SynerChi
What makes SynerChi so special?
SynerChi Kombucha is authentic fermented kombucha, we use only certified organic green tea, golden cane sugar and SCOBY (kombucha culture) to create it. We never heat treat our kombucha meaning itâs a truly âliving drinkâ full of everything you want to find in a ârealâ kombucha.
What is the recommended daily amount?
When it comes to kombucha there are no hard and fast rules about what is the ârightâ amount. Naturally taking the nutritional content into consideration according to your own personal diet is appropriate. We happily drink a bottle or can every day.
Can I drink it every day?
Yes :)
Whatâs ââSCOBYââ?
S.C.O.B.Y. is an acronym that stands for Symbiotic Culture Of Bacteria and Yeast. While its most often called a SCOBY you will also find it referred to as âkombucha motherâ, âkombucha mushroomâ, or even âkombucha pellicleâ. But they all basically mean the same thing and itâs the live starter culture which is used to brew authentic kombucha like SynerChi
What is the connection between Kombucha and Gut health?
Kombucha (like SynerChi) is a living drink full of live natural cultures. Consuming a healthy fresh food diet (plenty of prebiotic fibre) along with plenty of âgood bacteriaâ from natural ferments (like SynerChi) feeds and supports the microbiome in the gut. We can direct you towards some sources of info that we like via the blog
Are they gluten free?
Yes all our products are gluten free. We lab test regularly to ensure this.
Do we use sweeteners?
We use only natural stevia in our canned kombucha. No ânastiesâ
Why does the Sugar Free Kombucha in cans have Golden cane sugar in the ingredients?
This is because ingredients are expressed at the âmixing bowlâ stage of production (Nutritional information is derived from whatâs in the pack) For our Sugar Free kombucha we ferment all the sugar âoutâ (i.e. the SCOBY consumes it) and we blend back the fermented kombucha with a little natural stevia to create a tasty sugar free brew.
Is it suitable for Vegans and Vegetarians?
Yes
Are they suitable and safe for children?
Yes, however we recommend being conscious of the child being of a suitable age to consume green tea. A little diluted kombucha is enjoyed by our own littles ;)
Are they suitable during pregnancy?
If you are pregnant and you would like to drink Kombucha, but have questions around itâs suitability we recommend you seek advice from your GP or health care provider. SynerChi kombucha is produced to the highest safety standards (and is BRC certified) However in pregnancy itâs always best to check any concerns with your own doctor.
