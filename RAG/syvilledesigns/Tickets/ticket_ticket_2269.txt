Subject: Urgent Support Request: Dell XPS 13 9310 Issue
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I am writing to bring to your attention a recurring issue I have been experiencing with my Dell XPS 13 9310. After the latest Windows update, my device has started showing a persistent blue screen error, significantly affecting its performance and usability.

This problem began immediately following the installation of the new update, with the blue screen appearing almost every time I start or restart the computer. Additionally, the overall performance of the device has noticeably declined, with tasks that should be simple now taking considerably more time and applications frequently crashing.

I rely heavily on this laptop for work and personal tasks, making this issue particularly urgent. I attempted some basic troubleshooting steps like rebooting in safe mode and searching for further system updates, but the problem persists.

Please advise on possible solutions or whether this is a known issue with a current fix underway. Understanding how critical this device is to my daily routine, I would appreciate a swift response.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
