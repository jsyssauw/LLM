Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support, 

I am writing to seek assistance regarding frequent Wi-Fi disconnections that I am experiencing with my TP-Link Access Point EAP245. The device has been intermittently disconnecting from the network, causing significant disruption to my work.

Could you please provide guidance on any specific troubleshooting steps I might be missing, or suggest a possible resolution to this issue? My account number is <acc_num>, and I am reachable at <tel_num> if you need any further information. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out about the issues with your TP-Link EAP245. I understand how disruptive this can be. Since you have already tried power cycling and updating the firmware, here are a few additional steps you can try:

1. Check for Interference: Ensure there are no other electronic devices causing interference. Moving the access point to a different location might help.
2. Change Wireless Channels: Access the device settings and try changing the channel to avoid congestion.
3. Check for Overheating: Ensure that the device has adequate ventilation.
4. Examine Network Settings: Make sure network configurations are correct and no restrictions are set.

If these steps donâ€™t resolve the issue, we might need to explore potential hardware problems or configuration settings in more detail.

Feel free to contact us directly at customer support using your account number <acc_num>, or if you prefer, I can reach you at <tel_num> for further assistance.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
