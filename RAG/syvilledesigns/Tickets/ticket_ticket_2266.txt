Subject: Request to Change Maintenance Schedule
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear IT Services Support Team, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a review and possible change to the current maintenance window scheduled for our AWS Management Service deployment. We have been experiencing service outages during peak hours, which is significantly impacting our operations and customer experience. 

Currently, the maintenance activities are aligned with a timeframe that coincides with our highest traffic periods. This overlap has led to unanticipated downtime, affecting our ability to deliver consistent service to our clients. To mitigate these disruptions, we kindly request that the maintenance window be adjusted to off-peak hours. This adjustment would allow us to maintain seamless service delivery while still ensuring crucial updates and maintenance are performed. 

Additionally, could you please provide more insight into the regularity and duration of these maintenance windows so we can better plan our resource allocation and manage client expectations? Your immediate attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated, as it is vital for our operational efficiency. Thank you for your understanding and assistance. 

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
