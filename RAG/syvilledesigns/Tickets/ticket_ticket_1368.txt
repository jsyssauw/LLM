Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request the integration of new extensions in Visual Studio Code version 1.70. It would be greatly beneficial if these extensions could enhance debugging capabilities and improve overall productivity for developers. During daily coding tasks, enhanced debugging tools significantly streamline the development process, saving valuable time and reducing potential errors. Additionally, productivity-focused extensions can boost efficiency due to advanced features that help manage tasks more effectively. I am confident that these improvements would be highly appreciated by users and facilitate a more robust development environment in Visual Studio Code.
