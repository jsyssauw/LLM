Subject: Unexpected renewal issue with Office 365 subscription
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a billing issue associated with my account <acc_num>. Recently, an unexpected renewal charge for my Microsoft Office 365 subscription appeared on my statement, despite my previous cancellation request. On <date>, I contacted your support team regarding the cancellation of this subscription. I even received confirmation from a representative named <name>. However, I was surprised to find the charge still present within my latest billing cycle, reflecting a charge date of <date>. My payment was processed via the credit card ending in <last_four_digits>, and I want to avoid any inconvenience or confusion going forward. Hence, I would appreciate your immediate attention to reverse this charge credited to my account and ensure my subscription does not renew further. I've appreciated your support team's assistance in the past and hope for a swift resolution of this issue. Please feel free to contact me at <email_address> or <tel_num> should you require any further clarification. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Kind regards, <name>
