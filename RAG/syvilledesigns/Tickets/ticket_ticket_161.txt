Subject: Issue with Detachable Keyboard on Surface Pro 7
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern regarding a persistent issue with my Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Recently, I have noticed that the detachable keyboard is not being recognized during use, which significantly impacts my productivity. As someone who relies heavily on this device for daily tasks, having the keyboard not function as intended is incredibly frustrating.

Despite multiple attempts to reconnect the keyboard, it remains unresponsive while attached. This problem not only affects my work efficiency but also reduces the overall usability of the Surface Pro 7. I would appreciate any guidance or troubleshooting steps that could help resolve this issue promptly.

Furthermore, if this issue persists, could you advise on possible warranty service or replacement options available to me? Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your prompt response.

Warm regards,
