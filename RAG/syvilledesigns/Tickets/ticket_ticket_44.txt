Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team, 

I am writing to report a critical issue we are experiencing with the Jira Software, version 8.20, used for managing our project tasks and tracking. The system is down, impacting our team's ability to view and update project statuses across multiple departments. This outage is causing significant disruptions in our workflow, hindering communication and collaboration among team members.
