Subject: Product Exchange Request
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I am writing to request an exchange of a product I recently purchased at Tech Online Store. The item in question is the HP DeskJet 3755 printer, which I have been experiencing wireless connection issues with since the initial setup. Despite following all the recommended troubleshooting steps provided in your support documentation, the device continues to fail in establishing a stable wireless connection essential for my home office needs. 
 
I have attempted multiple resets and verified my network settings are configured correctly; however, the issue persists. Given the circumstances, I am inclined to believe the issue may be due to a hardware fault in the original purchase. 

I am requesting an exchange for a new unit under the assumption that the warranty or product return policy covers such defects and issues. Please let me know the necessary steps I need to follow in order to facilitate the exchange process and ensure minimal disruption to my day-to-day operations. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
