Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

We appreciate your message regarding the problems with your Cisco Router ISR4331. We recognize the importance of network reliability for your organization, and we are committed to assisting you.

To start the troubleshooting process, please ensure the router’s firmware is current and inspect for any visible damage or loose connections in the setup. We also suggest rebooting the router if it hasn’t been restarted recently, as that might temporarily resolve the issue.

We would appreciate it if you could share the logs from the System and Interface to facilitate a more thorough examination. Our technical team will then perform an in-depth investigation to determine the underlying cause and offer you a solution.

In the meantime, if you need further assistance, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our support hotline at your convenience.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
