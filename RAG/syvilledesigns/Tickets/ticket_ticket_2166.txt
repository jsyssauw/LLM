Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I am writing to address an urgent issue regarding an incorrect billing on my account. Last month, I purchased an Adobe Photoshop 2024 subscription through your platform, but I have noticed discrepancies in the billing amount. The charge appears to be higher than what was initially agreed upon during the purchase confirmation.

My account number is <acc_num> and the unexpected charge was posted on my statement dated <date>. I am concerned with this error as it affected my bank balance unexpectedly. I kindly request a prompt review and adjustment of this charge. Please contact me at <email> or my phone number <tel_num> if further information is required.

Your immediate attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
<name>
