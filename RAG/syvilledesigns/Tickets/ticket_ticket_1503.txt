I am writing to seek urgent assistance regarding a connection issue with the Zoom product version 5.11.0. One of our users, <name>, is unable to join a scheduled video meeting. Every attempt to connect results in an error message indicating a connection failure, even though the internet connection is stable. This problem requires immediate attention as it disrupts our operations significantly. We have already attempted basic troubleshooting steps such as restarting the application and checking network settings, all to no avail.

Please provide guidance and a potential resolution to this issue at your earliest convenience, as this matter is adversely affecting our productivity.

Sincerely,
