Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

I regret to hear about the complications you're facing with paper jams on your HP DeskJet 3755. To resolve this issue, ensure that the paper is loaded correctly and that the rollers are clean. Try to update the printer's firmware. If this does not solve the problem, you may want to reset the printer's settings. If the difficulties persist, we might need to investigate a replacement.

Feel free to contact us if you need further assistance.

Warm regards,
