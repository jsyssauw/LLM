Customer Issue: Esteemed Customer Support Team, 

I hope this message reaches you in high spirits. I am reaching out to notify you about a persistent issue with my Dell XPS 13 9310 laptop. Since I acquired this device, I have repeatedly faced serious performance dilemmas at startup. Specifically, the laptop tends to momentarily freeze after being powered on, requiring several restarts before it functions normally. This problem has progressively worsened, revealing an underlying issue that necessitates technical intervention.

In addition to this, I have noticed that the laptop's fan has grown considerably noisier than it was initially. This intrusive noise from the fan coincides with periods of diminished performance, leading me to suspect a link to the ongoing freezing obstacles I have encountered.

Taking these elements into account, I would greatly appreciate the assistance of a technician who could provide advice or look deeper into this issue to ensure there are no hardware defects affecting the laptop components. Having a fully functional laptop is essential for my professional activities, and dependable performance is imperative.

Thank you for your attention regarding this issue. I await your prompt reply.

Sincerely,
