Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to express concerns about ongoing Wi-Fi connectivity issues attributed to our Cisco Router ISR4331. Over the past few weeks, we have experienced regular performance dips, which we suspect are due to a router misconfiguration. These disruptions are significantly impacting our enterprise networking reliability and thus our business operations.

Despite attempts to resolve the issue through various troubleshooting measures, the problem persists, leading to outages that affect our work efficiency. We kindly request your assistance in resolving this issue as a priority. Could you please advise on potential solutions or schedule a technical visit at the earliest convenience?

Thank you for your immediate attention to this pressing issue.

Sincerely,
