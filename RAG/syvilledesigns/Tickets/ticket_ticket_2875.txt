Hello <name>,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the issues with user roles and permissions in your Jira Software version 8.20. To address this problem, you can try the following steps:

1. Verify Default Permissions: Navigate to your project's permission scheme and ensure default settings have not been inadvertently altered.

2. Project Roles: Go to the Administration section, then to Project Roles, and check that each role is assigned the correct permissions.

3. Synchronize Directories: Ensure that your group's permissions are in sync with your user directory if you are using an external directory.

4. Update and Reindex: Ensure that Jira is up-to-date with the latest patches and perform a reindex to resolve any underlying issues.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, a support specialist can assist you further. Please confirm if you would like this, and we will arrange it promptly. Let us know if more details are needed.

We are committed to getting your system back on track swiftly.
