Subject: Request for exchange of faulty Dell XPS 13
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about an issue with a recently purchased Dell XPS 13 model 9310, under account number <acc_num>. The laptop has been experiencing frequent crashes and performance issues, which I suspect may be due to a hardware malfunction. Given these unresolved issues, I would like to request an exchange for the faulty device.

Purchased two weeks ago, the laptop started showing signs of instability early on, disrupting my work with crashes occurring daily. I have attempted standard troubleshooting steps with no success. Therefore, I believe an exchange for a new unit is the best solution at this point.

Please let me know the necessary steps for processing this exchange. Feel free to contact me at my number <tel_num>.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

<name>
