Subject: Urgent Assistance Required for Printer Connectivity
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Hello Tech Online Store Support Team,

I'm writing to express my concern regarding my Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer, which is experiencing connectivity issues specifically when utilizing the mobile printing feature. I have followed all the instructions, such as ensuring the printer is connected to the same wireless network as my mobile device and verifying that the Canon PRINT app is up to date.

Despite these efforts, my attempts at printing directly from my smartphone remain unsuccessful. The device is visible within the app, yet moments after beginning a job, it fails to proceed, displaying an error. I've also attempted restarting both the printer and mobile device without any improvement.

Could you please provide guidance on additional troubleshooting steps or confirm if this is a known issue with a solution pending? My account number is <acc_num> should you need to review the purchase details. For any assistance or further queries, please reach me at <name>.<lastname>@email.com or via phone at <tel_num>.

Thank you for addressing this matter promptly.

Best regards,
