Customer Service answer: Hello <name>,

Thank you for reaching out about the connection issues with your HP DeskJet 3755 printer. To troubleshoot, please try the following steps:

1. Confirm that your Wi-Fi network is functioning and that the printer is within range.
2. Restart both your printer and Wi-Fi router.
3. Ensure the printer's Wi-Fi light is blinking; if not, press the Wireless button on the printer until it does.
4. Disconnect and reconnect the printer to the network using the HP Smart app or the WPS button on your router.
5. Make sure your router is configured to a 2.4GHz band, as the printer might not support 5GHz.

If the problem persists, please get back to us with details of any error messages received. We're here to help.
