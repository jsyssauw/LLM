Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for contacting us. We recommend starting by ensuring your laptop's BIOS and drivers are updated via Dell SupportAssist. Check if the ventilation is clear of dust and use the device on a hard, flat surface to ensure proper airflow. If the issue persists, consider performing a battery diagnostic test using the Dell Power Manager. Should these steps not resolve the problem, please provide further details so we can assist with a repair or replacement if necessary.

Best regards,
Customer Support
