Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report an issue we're experiencing with our TP-Link Access Point EAP245, following a recent application of new configuration settings provided through your network configuration service. Since implementing these changes, there have been intermittent connectivity issues that have severely affected our operations.

Our team has attempted multiple troubleshooting steps, including a reset of the access point and re-applying previous configurations, but we are still facing disruptions. Given the impact on our business, we would appreciate your immediate assistance in resolving these issues.

Please let us know how we can proceed or if you require further information from our end. Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
