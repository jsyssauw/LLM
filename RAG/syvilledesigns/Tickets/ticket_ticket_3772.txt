Subject: Inquiring about licensing options and bulk discounts for Adobe Photoshop 2024
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Hello Tech Online Store Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to inquire about the licensing options available for Adobe Photoshop 2024. Additionally, I am interested in understanding if there are any discounts available for bulk purchases, particularly in the pre-sales phase. As we are planning to integrate this into our new design workstation setups, knowing the details would be beneficial for our budgeting purposes. Could you please provide details on pricing tiers, any potential bulk purchasing discounts, and any relevant terms and conditions?

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,
