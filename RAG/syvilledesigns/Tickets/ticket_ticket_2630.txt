Subject: Screen Sharing Issues in Zoom
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to bring to your attention a persistent problem we are experiencing with Zoom version 5.11.0. My team and I have encountered significant difficulties with the screen-sharing function during Zoom calls. This issue critically affects our collaboration efforts and overall productivity during online meetings. We heavily rely on screen sharing to go through complex documents and presentations collaboratively. The malfunctioning feature has caused delays and misunderstandings among team members. 

I've already tried some initial troubleshooting steps such as resetting the application, ensuring the software is up to date, and verifying network conditions. However, these measures have not resolved the issue. I understand technology can be nuanced, and occasional bugs happen, yet I would greatly appreciate guidance on any additional steps we can take to address this matter effectively.

Could you please provide some technical assistance to help resolve this problem? We look forward to any solutions or workarounds you might suggest.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
