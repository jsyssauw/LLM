I recently updated my Dell XPS 13 9310 and am now experiencing an intermittent screen flicker severely affecting usability. This issue started immediately after the update. I'm unsure if it's due to hardware or software but need assistance ASAP. Kindly provide guidance on troubleshooting or initiate a repair if necessary.
