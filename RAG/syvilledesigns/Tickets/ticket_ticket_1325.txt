Subject: Incorrect Billing Issue with AWS Service
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Hello Customer Support,

I am writing to report an issue with the recent billing for our AWS Management Service account, <acc_num>. This month, we've noticed unexpected high data usage charges which we believe is incorrect. The invoice suggests a significant spike in data consumption, which does not align with our records and usual usage patterns.

Could you please investigate this discrepancy and provide us with an explanation or a possible correction? We are concerned about the impact of these charges on our budget. Feel free to reach me at <tel_num> for further explanations if needed.

Thank you for resolving this matter at your earliest convenience.

Best Regards,

<name>
