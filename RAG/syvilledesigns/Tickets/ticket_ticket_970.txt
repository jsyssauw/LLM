Subject: Urgent: Excel Crashing Issue
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team, I am writing to bring to your immediate attention a recurring issue with Microsoft Office 365 Excel. Whenever I attempt to open large spreadsheets, the application crashes unexpectedly. This ongoing issue is impacting our team's productivity and causing significant disruptions to our daily workflow. We have encountered this problem across various computers in our office, which runs on <name> IT Services. Given the critical role Excel plays in our operations, we require an urgent fix. Reinstalling the application and performing standard troubleshooting procedures, such as clearing caches and checking for updates, have not resolved the problem. We are extremely reliant on Excel for data management and reporting, thus any downtime hinders our ability to meet project deadlines and client expectations. It is imperative that a resolution is provided at the earliest possible convenience. I can provide error logs and further system details if required. Please prioritize this issue and advise us on the next steps to take. For any immediate queries, I can be reached at <tel_num>. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Best regards, <name>
Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us with this urgent issue. We understand the critical impact this Excel crashing problem has on your team's productivity and are here to assist you promptly.

Given that you have already tried common troubleshooting steps like reinstalling the application and clearing caches without success, we recommend the following additional steps:

1. Check for any large add-ins that might be causing the crash and disable them temporarily.
2. Ensure that all Windows updates and Office updates are completely installed.
3. Increase the available memory for Excel by closing other unnecessary programs running simultaneously.
4. Try opening the problematic files in Excel safe mode by holding the "Ctrl" key while launching Excel, this might help identify any startup issues.
5. Consider splitting the large spreadsheets into smaller, more manageable files as a temporary workaround.

Since the issue is occurring across various computers in your office, it can also be helpful to review network or server performance if the files are stored remotely. If the problem persists after these steps, please send us the error logs and any system details you have; this information will assist us in diagnosing the issue more effectively.

We are committed to resolving this matter swiftly to minimize any further disruptions. If you require immediate assistance, feel free to reach out to us by phone or email.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.
