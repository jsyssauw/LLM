Subject: Return Request for MacBook Air M1 Purchase
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently purchased a MacBook Air M1 from your online store, and my order arrived a few days ago. The order number associated with this purchase is <acc_num>. While the transaction was smooth and the product arrived on time, I have been reconsidering my decision and am experiencing buyer's remorse. 

The MacBook Air M1 package remains unopened, as I have not yet used it since delivery. I have decided not to keep it and would like to explore other options potentially more suited to my current needs. According to your store's return policy, I understand that returns can be made within 30 days of purchase as long as the product is in its original and unopened condition. 

I would appreciate your guidance on how to proceed with this return. Could you please provide detailed instructions on the return process, including any necessary labels or forms I might need and deadlines I must meet to ensure the return is successful?

Thank you for your assistance.

Regards,
