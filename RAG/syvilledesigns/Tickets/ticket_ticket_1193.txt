Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your Epson EcoTank ET-4760 printer. I understand how frustrating frequent paper jams can be, and I'm here to help.

Firstly, ensure that the paper is loaded correctly and that the type of paper is suitable for your printer. Check for any obstructions or debris in the paper feed area. It's also advisable to adjust the paper guides so they firmly hold the paper without bending it.

If the issue persists, try updating the printer's firmware and drivers, as manufacturers often release updates to address common issues such as paper jams. These can typically be downloaded from Epson's official website.

Should these steps not resolve the issue, I recommend contacting Epson's technical support directly for further assistance as they might have specific troubleshooting steps or updates regarding this problem.

Please feel free to reach out if you need further help.

Best regards, 

Customer Support Team
