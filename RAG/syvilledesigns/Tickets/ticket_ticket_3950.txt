Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support team,

I am writing to express my concerns regarding frequent network outages that seem to originate from our Cisco Router ISR4331. Over the past few weeks, we've experienced multiple interruption incidents likely caused by either a firmware or hardware malfunction of this router model. As a critical component of our network infrastructure, these outages have significantly impacted our daily operations.

We initially thought the problem might be transient; however, the persistence of these issues has raised suspicions of a potential defect. We have attempted several resets and configuration checks but to no avail. I would appreciate your guidance on resolving these disruptions, possibly exploring firmware updates or hardware diagnostics.

Please advise on the steps needed to initiate a formal investigation or repair process. We hope to resolve this swiftly, minimizing further impact on our operations. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
