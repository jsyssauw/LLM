Subject: Jira Project Settings Update
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to request assistance with changing the project settings in our Jira Software version 8.20 to accommodate a new scrum board configuration. Our current workflows are being impacted and we need to update these settings to enhance our project management process. Unfortunately, the current configuration does not support the new organizational parameters we wish to implement. This request is quite urgent as our teams rely heavily on smooth and efficient task tracking. Please advise on the necessary steps we should undertake or if there's a dedicated process or documentation that we must follow for these changes. Additionally, if any support or troubleshooting is needed from our side, kindly let us know so we can coordinate accordingly. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. Looking forward to your swift response. Thank you! Regards, <name> <email> <tel_num> <acc_num>
Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your Jira settings update for version 8.20. To modify your project settings and accommodate the new scrum board configuration, you may need to access the Jira project administration section, where you can adjust board settings and workflows. For comprehensive guidance, please refer to the Jira documentation available online or consult the scrumming section under project settings.

If the necessary changes aren't possible via the user interface, submitting a support ticket within Jira might facilitate the process. Meanwhile, ensure any team roles or permissions align with the desired settings to prevent disruptions.

Feel free to contact us for further assistance. We're here to help.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
