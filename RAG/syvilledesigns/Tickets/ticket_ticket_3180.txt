Subject: Billing Error for Recent Purchase
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support, 

I am writing to bring to your attention a billing error that I encountered after purchasing some extensions from your store. My account, registered under the name <name> and account number <acc_num>, was charged incorrectly for Google Chrome 102.0 extensions.

On reviewing my statement, I noticed a discrepancy involving the aforementioned purchase, with an unexpected additional charge. The total billed does not align with the cost displayed at checkout, leading to a significant difference that I am eager to resolve. I suspect a system oversight may have caused this billing anomaly.

Considering the circumstances, I kindly request that you investigate this issue at your earliest convenience and adjust the charges accordingly. Please let me know if any further details are required from my end. I am hoping for a prompt resolution to avoid any disruption in services.

For quick communication, feel free to reach me at <tel_num> or via this email address.

Thank you for attending to this matter promptly.

Best regards,
