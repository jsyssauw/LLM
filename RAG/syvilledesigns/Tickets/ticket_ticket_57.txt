Subject: Issue with HP DeskJet 3755 Printer
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to report an issue with my recent purchase from your store, the HP DeskJet 3755 wireless all-in-one printer. Since I started using it, the printer has been frequently jamming paper during the return processing, causing a significant disruption to my printing tasks.

I have followed all the troubleshooting steps provided in the manual, such as checking for any obstructions and ensuring that the paper is properly aligned, but unfortunately, the problem persists. This issue is concerning, considering the printer is brand new and within the warranty period.

Could you please advise on the necessary steps to resolve this malfunction? I am hoping for either a replacement or a repair solution at your earliest convenience. My account number is <acc_num>. I am eager to resolve this matter swiftly and continue utilizing the excellent services that your store is known for.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
<name>
