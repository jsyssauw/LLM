Subject: AWS Performance Issues
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear IT Services Support Team,

I am writing to report a critical issue concerning the AWS Management Service that our client, <name>, is currently facing. Our team has noticed significant performance issues, particularly an inability to deploy updated backend service changes due to extensive cloud instance lag. This issue is severely impacting operations and delaying important updates that are necessary for our clientâ€™s optimal functioning. We believe this might be linked to the AWS Management Service lagging, which needs immediate attention to identify and rectify the root cause.

Kindly prioritize this matter and guide us on how to proceed with troubleshooting steps or if additional resources can be allocated from your side.

Best regards,

<name>
