Subject: Exchange Request for Printer
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I am writing to request an exchange for my recently purchased Epson EcoTank ET-4760 printer. Upon setting it up, I experienced faulty wireless connectivity issues straight out of the box. As this is crucial for my home office efficiency, I would appreciate a swift resolution.

The printer's unreliable connection prevents it from fulfilling its intended purpose, and I believe it may be a defect with this particular unit. I kindly ask for your guidance on the steps to initiate the exchange process. Attached is my purchase receipt from <date>. My order number is <order_num>. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please reach me at <tel_num> or email.

Sincerely,
<name>
