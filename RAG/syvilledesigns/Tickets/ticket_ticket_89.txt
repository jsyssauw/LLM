Customer Issue: Hello Customer Support,

I am writing to seek assistance with a screen flickering issue I've been experiencing with my Dell XPS 13 9310 Ultrabook. The product seems to have developed this problem recently, and it is causing significant inconvenience, especially during work. I've checked for driver updates and ensured all system updates are installed, but unfortunately, the issue persists. Could you please provide guidance on possible solutions or steps I can take to rectify this? If necessary, I am prepared to provide additional details such as purchase receipt or technical logs. I would appreciate your prompt support in resolving this matter. Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,

Customer Service answer: Hello <name>,

Thank you for reaching out about your Dell XPS 13 9310 screen issue. Please try adjusting the refresh rate in the display settings and disable any unnecessary startup programs. If these steps don't resolve the problem, resetting the graphics driver is recommended. You can do this by pressing "Win + Ctrl + Shift + B" keys simultaneously. If the screen flickering continues, providing us with your purchase receipt and any technical logs might be necessary for further investigation. 

If these steps donâ€™t help, please let us know, and we can explore servicing options.

Best regards,
Customer Support
