I am writing to report persistent paper jam issues with my Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer. The problem occurs during light checkout documentation printing. I have ensured that the paper is not overloaded, and I have also checked for any visible obstructions. Despite these efforts, the issue persists. Could you please provide me with further assistance or suggest any additional troubleshooting steps? My printer's serial number is <acc_num>.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
