Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern regarding some issues I've been experiencing while using IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1, specifically related to the refactoring features for Java code development. It appears that these features are not functioning as intended, causing disruptions to my workflow. I've encountered problems where certain refactoring actions are either incomplete or not executed at all, leading to unexpected results in my code. These issues have been persistent and are hindering my productivity significantly.

I would appreciate any guidance or solutions you could offer to resolve this matter. If there are updates or patches available, please advise on the steps needed to apply them. Additionally, if there are known workarounds, I would be grateful for any documentation or support materials that could assist me in navigating this situation.
