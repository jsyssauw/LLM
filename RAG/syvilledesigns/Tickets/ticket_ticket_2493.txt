Subject: Issue with AWS Billing Charges
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I am writing to report an issue concerning incorrect billing charges on my recent invoice for the AWS Management Service under my account number <acc_num>. Upon reviewing the charges, I noticed discrepancies that do not align with the services used. It seems that charges have been applied for services that were neither requested nor authorized on my account. As I rely on precise billing for budget forecasting and reconciliation, this issue has caused significant disruption to my financial management process. 

To address this matter promptly, I kindly request a detailed reconciliation of my last monthâ€™s charges. Please include all activities, associated costs, and service modifications that justify the charges. Such transparency will greatly aid in identifying where the discrepancies occurred. Additionally, could you check if there may have been any clerical errors or misconfigurations? Your immediate assistance in resolving this matter will be greatly appreciated, as it assures me of the continued value and trustworthiness of your services. 

Please feel free to contact me at my phone number <tel_num> should you need any further information to expedite the resolution of this issue. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

<name>
