Subject: Exchange Request for Malfunctioning Dell XPS 13
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request an exchange for my recently purchased Dell XPS 13 9310. Unfortunately, the device's display was malfunctioning right out of the box, which has been quite disappointing. My order number is <order_num>, and it was delivered on <delivery_date>.

I believe I am eligible for an exchange as per your storeâ€™s policy. Please advise on how to proceed with this process. I am eager to receive a fully functioning replacement.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
