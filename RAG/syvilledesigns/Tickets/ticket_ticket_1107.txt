Customer Service answer: Hello <name>,

I appreciate you getting in touch. I apologize for the trouble you're having with the battery of your MacBook Air M1. Since your purchase was recent, it should fall under the warranty. Please ensure that your device has the latest software updates applied as this can occasionally fix battery problems.

To move forward, I recommend visiting an Apple Authorized Service Provider or an Apple Store for a diagnostic check. Be sure to bring your proof of purchase and account number <acc_num> along.

Best regards,
Customer Support
