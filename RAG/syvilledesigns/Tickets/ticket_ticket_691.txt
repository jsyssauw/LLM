Subject: Urgent: Database Service Issue
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I am writing to report a significant issue with our database services impacting client access and causing severe disruption to operations at our company. We are experiencing an ongoing outage with the PostgreSQL 14.3 database, which is critical for our day-to-day operations and client service delivery. 

It appears that the service became unavailable at approximately 9:00 AM today, and despite extensive internal efforts to resolve it, the issue persists. This has rendered key applications inoperative, and we are unable to fulfill client requests efficiently. As a result, our business operations are severely disrupted at many levels.

We require immediate assistance from your technical support team to identify the cause of this outage and to facilitate a quick resolution. I entreat you to treat this matter with the utmost urgency as every minute of delay adversely affects our business and client relationships.

Thank you for your prompt attention. Please contact me at <tel_num> or respond to this email at your earliest convenience. Resolution of this issue is paramount.

Best regards,

<name> <acc_num>
