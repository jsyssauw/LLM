Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I am reaching out for assistance with effectively configuring Jira Software 8.20 for project management using Scrum and integrating it with Confluence. Despite best efforts, we are facing challenges in setting up a streamlined workflow that aligns with Scrum methodologies. We aim to leverage Jira's capabilities in conjunction with Confluence to enhance team collaboration and documentation processes.

Could you please provide guidance or resources specific to configuring projects in Jira 8.20 for Scrum? Additionally, any recommended best practices, tutorials, or documentation links would be extremely helpful. Our goal is to optimize our project management process and ensure our team can utilize Jira Software and Confluence to their fullest potential.

Thank you for your support.

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. To configure Jira Software 8.20 for Scrum, begin by creating a Scrum project under "Projects" and selecting "Create Project." Choose the Scrum template to get started. Ensure your project's board is set to display the most relevant tasks using filters and columns that match your workflow.

For integration with Confluence, navigate to the Jira settings, find "Products" in the menu, and manage the application links to link your Confluence site. Ensure both applications are permitted to communicate for seamless access and integration of documentation.

For optimizing your workflow:
1. Define your epics, user stories, and tasks clearly within Jira.
2. Regularly update your sprint backlog in coordination with your team.
3. Use Jira's Agile boards to visualize work in progress and track team performance against the sprint goal.

Some best practice resources include Atlassian's documentation on Jira and Confluence integration and their walk-through guides for setting up Scrum projects. Check out:
