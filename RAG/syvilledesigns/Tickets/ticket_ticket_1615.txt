Subject: Screen Flickering Issue with MacBook Air M1 After Update
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I've encountered with my MacBook Air M1, which I've been experiencing intermittently since the latest macOS update. I purchased this device from your store last year, and it has been functioning seamlessly until recently. However, following the software update, I've noticed a persistent screen flickering problem that seems to arise unexpectedly during various activities.

The screen flickering occurs randomly and affects my ability to work efficiently, which is becoming increasingly frustrating. It seems to occur particularly when switching between apps or when the device is under a specific processing load. I rely on my MacBook for both personal and professional tasks, and this disruption is quite inconvenient.

I have attempted a few basic troubleshooting steps, such as restarting the device, resetting the PRAM, and ensuring all applications are up to date, but these measures have not resolved the problem. Unfortunately, the flickering often requires me to reboot the device entirely to regain use, which is not a viable long-term solution.

Given that this issue appeared shortly after the update, I believe it might be related to a software compatibility problem. I was hoping you could provide further guidance or suggest any potential fixes. If necessary, I am willing to bring the laptop in for a technical assessment and repair work.

Furthermore, I would appreciate advice on whether this issue could be covered under my current warranty or AppleCare plan. Could you please inform me about any possible costs if repairs are required? I am keen to resolve this matter swiftly to avoid any further disruptions to my work.

Thank you in advance for your assistance and timely response. I am looking forward to hearing back from you soon so I can continue using my MacBook Air M1 without interruptions.

Warm regards,

<name>

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the screen flickering issue with your MacBook Air M1. We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused.

Given that this issue began after the recent update, it may indeed be related to software compatibility. We recommend trying the following steps if you haven't already:
1. Update your MacBook to the latest macOS version, as subsequent updates may address this issue.
2. Boot your MacBook in Safe Mode to see if the flickering persists. This can help determine if a third-party application might be causing the problem.
3. Check for any graphics configuration changes in System Preferences that might alleviate the flickering.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, please consider bringing your MacBook in for a diagnostic assessment. 

Regarding warranty, if your device still falls under the standard warranty or you have AppleCare, this issue might be covered, possibly minimizing or eliminating repair costs. Our tech team can provide detailed cost estimates after the assessment.

Feel free to respond to this email or contact us directly at <tel_num> with any further questions or to schedule a repair appointment.

We're committed to helping you resolve this swiftly.

Best regards,
