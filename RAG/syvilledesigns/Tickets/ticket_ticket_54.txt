Subject: Request for changes in Jira user permissions setup
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request assistance in modifying the user permissions setup within our Jira project management software, specifically version 8.20. My name is <name>, and I am the project manager at <company_name>, overseeing the project installations and configurations for our team.

Currently, we are encountering a few challenges with the permissions in our Jira setup. We have recently expanded our team and brought in a few new members whose roles do not seem to align perfectly with our existing permissions configuration. This has led to some difficulties in terms of task allocations and access rights, hindering our workflow efficiency.

We would appreciate it if you could provide guidance on how to adjust these permissions to better fit our current team structure. In particular, it would be beneficial if new hires' roles could be set up with a more appropriate permission level concerning EEF access and task management. I believe a reassessment of our current permission schemes could help streamline our processes and prevent further access issues.

Could you please advise us on the steps necessary to adjust these settings appropriately, or if there is a preferred onboarding procedure for aligning permission settings with role updates? Additionally, if there are templates or documentation available to assist us, we would be most grateful to receive those.

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your prompt response at your earliest convenience.

Warm regards,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the modification of user permissions in your Jira setup. I understand the importance of having the correct permissions aligned with your new team structure, especially for efficient task management and EEF access.

To adjust the permissions for your new team members, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Review Current Permission Schemes:** Navigate to Jira settings and review the existing permission schemes. Identify where new roles may need adjustments.
   
2. **Customize Permissions:** For each new role, update the permission configurations under the "Project Settings" to ensure access rights align with the responsibilities of your team members, including task allocations.

3. **Utilize Documentation:** Jira offers extensive documentation and templates related to permission management. These can be accessed from the Jira Support portal.

4. **Onboarding Process:** For onboarding new hires, consider setting up a template for role-specific permissions to streamline the process in the future.

If further assistance is needed, consider reaching out to a certified Jira administrator in your organization or through our support portal for more tailored support.

Please let us know if there's anything else we can assist you with, and don't hesitate to contact us again.

Warm regards,

Customer Support Team
