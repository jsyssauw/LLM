Subject: Request for Modification in IT Consulting Strategy
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear IT Consulting Support Team,

I am writing to request a modification in our current IT consulting strategy service to enhance our server performance and improve cost efficiency. The consulting service has been beneficial, but we believe there is room for optimization to align with our strategic goals better. Could you provide guidance or arrange a meeting with a consultant who can assist us in implementing these changes? Please contact me at <tel_num> or reply to this email at your earliest convenience. I look forward to discussing potential solutions.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
