Subject: Concerns regarding MacBook Air M1 battery performance
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express concerns regarding the battery performance of my recently purchased MacBook Air M1. Despite being a new device, I have noticed that the battery life does not meet the expected performance standards advertised by Apple. As I use my MacBook predominantly for work, it is crucial for the battery to last longer to maximize productivity.

Could you provide me with suggestions on how to optimize the settings? Any tips on adjustments that could enhance battery longevity would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, if there are official updates or guidelines from the manufacturer addressing such issues, please let me know. Thank you for your assistance in resolving this matter.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
