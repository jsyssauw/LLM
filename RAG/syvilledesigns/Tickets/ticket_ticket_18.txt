Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a detailed explanation of some unexpected monthly charges for AWS cloud resources as seen on my last bill. The charges seem unaccounted for, and since I utilize the AWS Management Service, it would be helpful for me to understand the breakdown. Would you please help clarify these charges? My account number is <acc_num>. For further correspondence, you can reach me at <nameemail>@domain.com or call me at <tel_num>. Your prompt assistance with this matter is appreciated. 

Thank you. 

Best regards, 
<name>
