Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue related to my recent purchase of the Google Workspace Business Standard from your store. Upon reviewing my bank statements, I noticed that my account has been debited twice for this single purchase. This double billing has caused inconvenience, and I am quite concerned about this error.

To resolve this, I kindly request that you initiate a refund for the duplicate charge made to my account <acc_num>. Additionally, I would appreciate some clarification on how such an error occurred in the first place, to ensure it does not happen in future transactions. 

Please find the necessary transaction details attached for your reference. I would appreciate a prompt resolution to this matter. You can reach me at <tel_num> if any further information is required.
