Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek assistance regarding a wireless setup issue I am experiencing with my printer, the Canon PIXMA MG3620. Currently, I am unable to connect the printer to my Wi-Fi network, which is affecting my ability to complete printing tasks efficiently.

I've attempted several troubleshooting methods, including resetting the printer and checking my Wi-Fi connection for other devices, but unfortunately, the issue persists. Given the importance of having a functional wireless connection for my printing needs, I'd greatly appreciate any guidance or detailed instructions you could provide to resolve this setup problem.

Could you please advise on the next steps to take, or if there's some documentation available that could help me to address this issue? Your support would be immensely helpful in ensuring my printer functions as it should.

Thank you in advance for your assistance. Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
