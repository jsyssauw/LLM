Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern regarding a billing issue I have encountered with a recent purchase from your store. On October 12, 2023, I purchased a subscription for Adobe Photoshop 2024 using my account number <acc_num>. However, I have noticed a discrepancy between the amount charged and the official listed price.

The advertised price on your website at the time of purchase was $49.99, yet my card was charged $59.99. I am certain this is a mistake and would appreciate assistance in resolving this overcharge. I have attached a copy of my billing receipt for reference.

Please let me know if you require any additional information from my end to expedite the review process. I expect that such issues are treated with urgency, and I trust that your company values customer satisfaction. Should I contact another department for a faster resolution, kindly direct me accordingly.

I look forward to your prompt response on this matter. Thank you for your attention to this issue.

Best regards,
