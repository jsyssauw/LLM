Subject: Request for Product Exchange Due to Connectivity Issues
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request an exchange for my Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer. I am experiencing significant wireless connectivity issues, which severely impacts its usage and my workflow. Despite following all troubleshooting steps outlined in the user manual, the problem persists.

The printer frequently loses connection in the middle of print jobs, which is causing unnecessary delays. Given the circumstances and inconvenience faced, I kindly request an exchange for this product.

Please let me know the procedure to initiate this process. My account number is <acc_num>, and you can reach me at <tel_num> for any further information.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Regards,
