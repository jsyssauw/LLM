Subject: Exchange Request for Canon PIXMA MG3620 Due to Print Quality Issues
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support Team,

I am writing to request an exchange for a recently purchased Canon PIXMA MG3620 wireless printer, which has been experiencing print quality issues. Upon setup and initial use, I noticed that the printouts are consistently banded and have faded colors, affecting the overall quality of the printed materials. This has persisted despite following all recommended troubleshooting steps, including re-aligning the printhead and cleaning the nozzles.

I purchased the printer through your online store using account number <acc_num> on September 18th, and it arrived on September 22nd. I would appreciate if you could facilitate an exchange for a new unit as soon as possible, as I rely on this printer for daily work tasks. Please let me know how to proceed with the return and any details regarding shipment or additional documentation that might be required.

Thank you for addressing this matter promptly. I look forward to your quick response.

Regards,
