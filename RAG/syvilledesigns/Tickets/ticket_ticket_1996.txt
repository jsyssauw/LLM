I wish to escalate an issue we are currently facing with our Cisco Router ISR4331. The connection drops out consistently, severely impacting our operations. The router frequently disconnects, requiring us to perform a reset each time to re-establish connectivity. This issue has persisted over the last week and has started affecting our daily productivity, causing severe delays.
