Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the deployment issues with AWS resources. We understand the urgency and are here to assist you.

Firstly, ensure that all IAM roles and permissions are correctly configured. Sometimes deployment fails due to insufficient permissions. Verify the service limits are not being exceeded, as this could also cause unexpected failures.

If these checks don't resolve the issue, review the AWS CloudTrail logs for any errors or unusual activities. Additionally, consider using the AWS CloudFormation or Elastic Beanstalk service logs to get more detailed error messages.

Should you need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us directly. We are committed to resolving this issue promptly to minimize the impact on your operations.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
