Subject: Assistance Needed for Touchscreen Issues with Surface
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Hello Tech Online Store Support Team,

I'm writing to report touchscreen responsiveness issues with my Microsoft Surface Pro 7. The touchscreen has been unresponsive and intermittently fails to register touch inputs, making it difficult to use the device effectively. I suspect it might be related to outdated Windows 10 drivers as I have not updated recently.

Could you please guide me through updating the necessary drivers or provide any troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue? I would appreciate detailed instructions as I am not very tech-savvy.

For reference, my account number is <acc_num> and you can reach me at <tel_num>.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
