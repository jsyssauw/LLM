Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the current availability and possible delivery options for the HP DeskJet 3755 wireless printer available in your online store. I am interested in purchasing this model due to its compact design and wireless capabilities, which perfectly suit my home office setup.

Could you please provide information on whether this printer is currently in stock? Additionally, I would like to know about the standard and expedited shipping options to my location. If possible, please include any potential delivery timelines and any extra costs or promotions associated with these services.

Also, if the HP DeskJet 3755 is not available at the moment, could you inform me about an approximate restocking schedule or recommend any similar models that might be available? 

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your prompt response. Please feel free to reach me at my email or at <tel_num> for any necessary clarifications. 

Best regards,
