Subject: Overcharged for Microsoft Office 365 Subscription
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding my recent charge for the monthly subscription of Microsoft Office 365 under the account number <acc_num>. I have noticed that I was overcharged on my last billing statement. I was expecting to be billed the usual amount, but it seems a higher amount was deducted. Could you please investigate and provide an immediate reimbursement for the excess charge? Your prompt attention to this matter is highly appreciated.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
