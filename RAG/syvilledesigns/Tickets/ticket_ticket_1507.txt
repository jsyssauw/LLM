Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

I understand your frustration with the 504 error in Jira Software 8.20. Typically, error 504 indicates a gateway timeout, suggesting a server-side issue. I suggest trying the following:

1. Clear your browser cache.
2. Check if the issue persists in another browser.
3. Ensure your network connection is stable. 
4. Contact your Jira administrator as they may need to consult with the server host.

If the problem continues, please let us know so we can assist you further.

Kind regards,
Customer Support
