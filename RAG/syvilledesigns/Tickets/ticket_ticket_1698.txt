Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently purchased a MacBook Air M1 from your online store last week under the order number <order_num>. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, I need to consider returning the product. Could you kindly provide me with detailed information on your return policy for unopened items such as this? I want to ensure I properly understand the guidelines and any potential restocking fees involved.
