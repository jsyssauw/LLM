Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the Zoom issues. We understand the urgency and importance of resolving these glitches impacting your webinars. 

To help address these disconnection, screen freeze, and audio delay problems, please try the following steps:

1. Ensure that all users are running the latest version of Zoom, as updates often include important bug fixes.
2. Check your internet connection for stability, as bandwidth issues commonly cause disconnections and delays.
3. Try using a wired connection for more reliable connectivity during sessions.
4. Adjust Zoom settings to lower the video quality if bandwidth is an issue.
5. Close all unnecessary applications that may be consuming bandwidth or processing power.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, please let us know so we can escalate the matter for more in-depth technical support. We are committed to minimizing disruptions and ensuring your webinars run smoothly.

Don't hesitate to contact us directly at <tel_num> or reply here for further assistance.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
