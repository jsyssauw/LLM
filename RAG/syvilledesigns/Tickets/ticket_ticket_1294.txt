Subject: Assistance Needed with Samsung 4K Setup
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support,

I recently purchased a Samsung QLED QN90A 4K TV from your website. I'm experiencing minor difficulties with setting up the 4K display settings. The picture doesn't appear as sharp and detailed as expected when in 4K mode. I've confirmed my HDMI cables are high-speed rated and that connected devices support 4K.

Could you please provide detailed guidance or troubleshooting steps to ensure optimal display settings? My purchase details are under account number <acc_num>, and I can be reached at <tel_num> for any further requirements.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
<name>
