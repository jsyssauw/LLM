Subject: Assistance Required for MacBook Language Settings
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek your assistance in changing the language settings on my MacBook Air M1 to French. Despite my efforts, I have been unable to successfully navigate through the system settings to complete this task. As a recent purchaser from your website, I believe your support team could provide the guidance needed to resolve this issue in a timely and efficient manner.

Currently, the language settings appear to be limited to English, and I would like to ensure that the French language option is properly configured for all applications and system prompts. Could you please provide a step-by-step guide or instructions on how I might proceed with adjusting the language settings? Additionally, if there are any specific software updates or settings adjustments required to enable French language support, I would appreciate your input on those as well.

For reference, my MacBook Air's serial number is <acc_num>, and I purchased it recently on <purchase_date>. If any further details would assist in providing guidance, please feel free to contact me at <email_address> or call me at <tel_num>.

Thank you very much for your assistance. I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
<name>
Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us for assistance with your MacBook Air M1. I'd be happy to guide you through changing the language settings to French.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Click on the Apple menu in the top left corner and select "System Preferences."
2. Click on "Language & Region."
3. Click the "+" button beneath the list of "Preferred languages" on the left side.
4. In the list that appears, find and select "French," then click "Add."
5. A message will appear asking if you'd like to use French as the primary language. Click "Use French."
6. Restart your Mac to apply these changes fully.

After rebooting, French should be configured across system prompts and applications. If you're prompted to adjust application language settings individually, please do so.

If your Mac is not showing French as an option, ensure your macOS is up to date by clicking on "System Preferences" and selecting "Software Update."

Should you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact us at <email_address> or <tel_num>.

We hope these instructions help and your experience in your preferred language is enjoyable.

Best regards,
Tech Online Store Support Team
