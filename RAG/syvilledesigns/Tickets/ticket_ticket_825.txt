Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team at Tech Online Store,

Iâ€™m writing to bring to your attention an issue I've encountered with my Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Recently, the touchscreen on this device has stopped functioning, which hinders its usability significantly. Without this feature working, I'm unable to perform essential tasks. The problem started and has progressively worsened, rendering the device nearly unusable. I have gone through regular troubleshooting steps like rebooting the device and ensuring that all updates have been applied, yet nothing has resolved the issue.
