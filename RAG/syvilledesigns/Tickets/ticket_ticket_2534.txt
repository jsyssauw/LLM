Ticket ID: ticket_2534
Subject: Request to Modify Jira Workflows
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out on behalf of our team at <company_name>. We have been utilizing Jira Software 8.20 as an essential tool for managing our project workflows, and it has significantly enhanced our productivity and project management capabilities. However, due to recent changes in our internal company policies, we require modifications to our existing workflows to better accommodate the new guidelines regarding ticket prioritization.

In line with our new company policies, we need the ability to adjust the prioritization settings within Jira to reflect the changes in how issues should be processed and managed. Specifically, we are looking to incorporate a customized priority field that aligns with our updated prioritization matrix. Additionally, we would like to implement a feature that allows for dynamic adjustments based on the real-time status of issues and overarching project goals.

Our objective is to ensure that our projects are managed more efficiently by allowing team members to categorize issues with the appropriate level of urgency as dictated by our new policy framework. Thus, we foresee the need for creating new custom workflows or modifying existing ones to include additional statuses and transition conditions which can accurately reflect these prioritization strategies.

Could you please provide guidance on the best approach for implementing these workflow modifications? We are particularly interested in understanding the technical feasibility, potential timelines, and any assistance you can provide in terms of configuration or necessary plugins which might need to be applied to support these changes. It would be extremely helpful to have any documentation or best practices from prior similar implementations to help us navigate this adjustment seamlessly.

We appreciate your attention to this matter and are hopeful for your expert advice on how to move forward. Please let us know a suitable time for us to discuss this in greater detail or if there are any initial resources you could provide to kickstart this process.

Thank you very much for your support.

Best regards,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us with your inquiry about modifying Jira workflows to align with your new company policies. We understand how important it is to tailor workflows to reflect internal procedures and enhance project management efficiency.

To achieve the desired modifications, we recommend the following steps:

1. **Customized Priority Field**: You'll need to create a new custom field in Jira which aligns with your prioritization matrix. This can be done through the Jira administration under 'Issues' > 'Custom fields'. Ensure that this field is linked to your project's screen schemes.

2. **Dynamic Adjustments**: Implementing real-time adjustments can be facilitated by utilizing Jira Automation rules. These rules can be configured to update fields or priorities automatically, based on issue status or changes.

3. **Workflows and Statuses**: For adding new statuses and transitions, you'll need to modify or create workflows via the 'Jira Administration' > 'Issues' > 'Workflows'. Be cautious to save and publish the workflows to apply the changes seamlessly.

4. **Plugins**: Depending on your specific needs, plugins like ScriptRunner for Jira might be valuable for scripting customized functionalities more robustly.

Regarding technical feasibility, our experience shows these modifications are quite achievable within Jira's robust framework. Generally, such changes can be configured over a couple of weeks, considering proper testing and implementation strategies.

We have documentation on customizing workflows and can also arrange a consultation session to help guide you through these processes effectively. Please let us know your availability for a meeting or if you wish to begin with any documentation highlights.

We are here to assist you with these modifications. For further resources, feel free to reach out to us anytime.

Best regards,

Customer Support Team
