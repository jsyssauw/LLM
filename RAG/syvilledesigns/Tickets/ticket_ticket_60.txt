Subject: Request for Billing Correction on Subscription
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to express a concern regarding a recent billing issue I experienced with my Google Workspace Business Standard subscription under account number <acc_num>. It appears that I have been incorrectly charged for a service I did not sign up for, and I would like to seek a refund or an adjustment to my account to rectify this issue.

On my invoice dated <invoice_date>, I noticed an unexpected charge for the Google Workspace Business Standard, which surprised me as I neither request this service nor have any requirement for it at this time. I have checked all my account settings and confirmed that there was no such subscription authorized from my end.

I kindly ask for your immediate assistance in addressing this billing error. Please review the related transaction in your system to verify the inaccuracy. A prompt refund of the incorrect charge or an adjustment on my account would be highly appreciated.

For your reference, my account details are as follows: Name: <name>, Phone number: <tel_num>. I would also appreciate if you could keep me updated about the status of this inquiry.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your resolution.

Sincerely,
<name>
