Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out and bringing this issue to our attention. We understand how disruptive this can be and are here to help. Please ensure you have the latest version of Visual Studio Code and all extensions are up to date. If the issue persists, try disabling extensions to identify if one might be causing the crashes. Additionally, you might want to check the VS Code logs for any error messages that could provide more context.

To assist further, it would be helpful to know the operating system you're using and any specific error messages or logs after a crash. Please feel free to send this information if needed. Our technical team will prioritize this and work towards a swift resolution.

We appreciate your patience and cooperation.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
