Since the recent firmware update, my Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer is no longer able to connect to Wi-Fi. This issue is affecting my ability to print from my mobile devices, which I rely on. Could you please assist me in resolving this matter quickly?

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Please try the following steps: 1. Turn off the printer and the Wi-Fi router, then switch them back on.
2. Use the WPS button to reconnect the printer to the Wi-Fi.
3. If that does not work, reset the network settings on your printer and reinstall the firmware.

Let us know if you need further assistance.

Best regards,
