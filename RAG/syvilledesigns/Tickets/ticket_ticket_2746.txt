Subject: Assistance Required for Samsung QLED Setup and HDR Optimization
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently purchased a Samsung QLED QN90A from your store, and I am in need of some assistance in setting up its smart TV functionality and optimizing the HDR settings for the best viewing experience.

Upon unboxing the TV, I followed the initial setup instructions provided in the manual. The basic setup process was quite straightforward, and I have successfully connected the unit to my <internet_service_name> Wi-Fi network. However, as I proceed to explore the smart TV features, I've encountered some issues that are beyond my expertise.

The main problem arises when I try to access some applications, which seem not to load or work correctly despite having a stable internet connection. I have already attempted to perform a factory reset and ensured that the firmware is updated to the latest version; unfortunately, these steps did not resolve my issues.

Additionally, I am looking for guidance on how to optimize the HDR settings for this specific model to make the most of its renowned picture quality. Since this is my first time using a Smart TV with HDR capabilities, any help to enhance the feature would be greatly appreciated.

Could you kindly advise on troubleshooting these smart TV functionality issues and offer recommendations for HDR setting adjustments? If a customer service technician could guide me through the process over the phone or suggest a possible appointment, I would be very grateful. My phone number is <tel_num>, and my preferred time for a call would be during evenings on weekdays.

Thank you for your attention and support.

Best regards,
