Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support, 

I am writing to request assistance regarding an issue I am experiencing with the installation of Adobe Photoshop 2024. I purchased the software for my <acc_num> and attempted to install it on my computer, but unfortunately, I am encountering an error message that states 'installation incomplete'. This has persisted despite several efforts on my part to resolve the issue.
