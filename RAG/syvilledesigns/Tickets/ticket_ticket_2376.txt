Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support, my Canon PIXMA MG3620 is producing streaked pages despite being in high-quality mode. Additionally, I'm experiencing wireless setup issues. Please advise on potential solutions. Thank you.
Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

For streaked pages, ensure the print heads are clean, as this often resolves quality issues. Use the cleaning tool in your printer's software or manually clean if necessary. For wireless setup, check your router's proximity, ensure the printer's Wi-Fi is enabled, and verify network credentials. If the issue persists, restart your router and printer, and try the setup again. Let us know if further assistance is needed.

Best regards,
Customer Support
