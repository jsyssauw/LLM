Subject: Recurring Crash in Visual Studio Code 1.70 Issue
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to bring to your attention a recurring issue I am facing with Visual Studio Code version 1.70. Recently, I have encountered persistent crashes whenever I attempt to open files with specific extensions. These crashes significantly disrupt my workflow and delay critical projects.

The problem appears to occur regardless of the file size or the specific tasks performed within Visual Studio Code. I have attempted several common troubleshooting steps, such as disabling extensions, clearing the application cache, and even reinstalling Visual Studio Code. Unfortunately, these efforts have not resolved the issue.

Given the impact this has had on my productivity, I urge you to investigate this matter and provide a suitable resolution. Please let me know if there are additional logs or diagnostics that I can furnish to assist in addressing this problem. I am hoping for a swift resolution to continue using your otherwise excellent software without hindrance.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
