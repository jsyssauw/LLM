Subject: Issue with Software Transaction Accuracy
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue Iâ€™ve encountered with a recent transaction for Adobe Photoshop 2024. My account number is <acc_num>, and I believe there might be a discrepancy in the billing amount charged. I made this purchase on the <date>, and when reviewing the billing details, I noticed a higher amount than initially agreed upon during the purchase process.

I was expecting the billed amount to reflect the promotional pricing that was advertised. However, upon checking my billing statement, the amount debited from my account was significantly over this expected price. This leads me to suspect a possible overcharge or a miscalculation performed by your billing system.

I would appreciate it if you could investigate this matter for me. Please confirm if the applied charges are accurate or if an error may have occurred. Attached to this email are screenshots of the promotion and my billing statement for your reference.

Could you also let me know the best way forward in resolving this discrepancy? I am keen to have this resolved promptly to avoid any further inconvenience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your swift response. Feel free to contact me via email or at <tel_num>.

Best regards,

<name>
