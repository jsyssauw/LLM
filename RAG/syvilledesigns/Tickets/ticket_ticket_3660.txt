Thank you for reaching out. To enable the Scrum board features in Jira Software version 8.20, please ensure that the "Scrum" option is enabled in your project settings. Go to Project Settings, navigate to Features, and enable Scrum if it's not already active. If you face any issues, donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch for further assistance.
