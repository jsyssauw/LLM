Customer Issue: Dear <name> Customer Support,

I am writing to bring to your attention a recurring issue with the code completion feature in IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1. This particular problem causes the application to crash frequently during development, which is hampering my productivity significantly. Each time I attempt to use the code completion feature, the software becomes unresponsive, eventually leading to a crash. I have tried the usual troubleshooting steps such as reinstallation and applying the latest updates, yet the issue persists. I would appreciate your guidance on how to resolve this problem at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your attention.
