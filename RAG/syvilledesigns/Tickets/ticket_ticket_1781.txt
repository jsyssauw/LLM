Subject: Issues with IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1 Code Refactoring
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear IT Services Customer Support,

I am experiencing issues with the code refactoring tools in IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1. During Java development, the tools are not responding as expected, which significantly hampers productivity. I've ensured that the IDE is updated and have restarted it multiple times without resolution. This technical glitch requires immediate attention to maintain project timelines. I would appreciate your guidance or a speedy patch to resolve this problem.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your IntelliJ IDEA issue. Please try the following steps: 

1. Clear the IDE cache via File > Invalidate Caches / Restart.
2. Check for any third-party plugins that might conflict and disable them temporarily.
3. Update your Java JDK to the latest version supported by IntelliJ IDEA.
4. If possible, try reverting recent code changes temporarily to isolate the issue.

If the problem persists after these steps, please contact JetBrains support for a more dedicated solution or check if any patches are available on their website.

Best regards,
