Subject: Touchscreen and Keyboard Issues with Surface Pro 7
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention some issues I have been experiencing with my recently purchased Microsoft Surface Pro 7. The main problems concern the touchscreen response and the detachable keyboard connection. 

Since purchase, the touchscreen functionality has been inconsistent, often failing to register my touch inputs accurately. This inconsistency significantly affects the usability of the device, as I primarily rely on the touch feature for my day-to-day tasks.

Furthermore, the detachable keyboard frequently disconnects from the device at random intervals. I have tried several troubleshooting steps including resetting the device, updating drivers, and even reattaching the keyboard several times per day. Despite these efforts, the problem persists. 

Given the challenges detailed above, I am kindly requesting assistance in resolving these issues. I trust that you may have encountered similar problems and possibly have solutions or processes in place to address them effectively. Please let me know how to proceed or if a replacement is necessary. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
