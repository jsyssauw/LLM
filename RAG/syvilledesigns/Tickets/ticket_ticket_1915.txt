Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Hello IT Services Support Team, I'm writing to update you regarding a recent issue we faced with our Jira Software 8.20. A user, named <name>, encountered access problems with the ticket system due to ongoing connectivity complications. Initially, all attempts to troubleshoot within the application proved ineffective. Upon deeper investigation, we looked into the browser settings and identified some misconfigurations that were causing disruptions during the application's loading. Adjusting these configurations provided a partial fix; however, the problem continued to occur sporadically. We then shifted our focus to possible network obstructions. We discovered that firewall settings within our security framework were impeding the necessary ports required for Jira's connectivity. Once we adjusted these settings to permit the required traffic, the issue was entirely resolved. The user and our team can now access and work with Jira Software smoothly without connectivity issues. We sincerely appreciate your team's assistance and resources. Please let us know if you have any best practices to suggest for minimizing such issues in the future. Thank you for your ongoing support. Best wishes, <name>

We are delighted to know that you were able to resolve the issue by modifying browser settings and adjusting the firewall rules.

To mitigate the chances of such problems arising again, we suggest routinely reviewing and updating your network configurations and browser settings. Moreover, ensure that all required ports for Jira are accessible and not blocked by any security measures. Keeping both the software and firewalls updated to their latest versions can also assist in preventing similar concerns in the future.
