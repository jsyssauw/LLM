Could you kindly assist by investigating what might be causing this flickering issue? Are there any known solutions or fixes I might attempt before sending the device for repair?

Your prompt assistance in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if any additional information is needed from my side.

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us about the issue with your Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Screen flickering can indeed be frustrating, so let's work towards a solution together.

Firstly, please ensure that your device is running the latest software updates. Sometimes, a simple software patch can resolve such problems. You might also want to try adjusting your display settings to see if that helps.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, you could attempt to boot your device in Safe Mode to determine if a third-party app is causing the glitch. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the Surface Pro support section on Microsoft's website.

Should the problem persist, it might be a hardware issue, and we can explore repair options. Please let us know if the above suggestions do not resolve the flickering so we can provide further assistance.

Feel free to share any additional details, like error messages or any recent changes made before the issue started. This information will help us in diagnosing the problem more effectively.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Best regards,
Tech Online Store Support Team
