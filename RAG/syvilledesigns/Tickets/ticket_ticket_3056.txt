Subject: Urgent: Networking Issues with Cisco Router ISR4331
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear IT Support Team,

I am writing to bring to your immediate attention some persistent networking issues we are experiencing with our Cisco Router ISR4331. Over the past few weeks, we have noticed significant disruption in connectivity, particularly manifesting as sudden drops and decreased performance during peak hours. This issue has increasingly become problematic, affecting our ability to maintain optimal operation levels. It is crucial for our operations to have stable and reliable network performance, and these interruptions are causing inefficiencies and downtime.

Our team has conducted preliminary diagnostics and ensured that there are no local network overloads or simple configuration issues that could account for these problems. Therefore, we suspect the router itself may be malfunctioning. We request your expert evaluation to identify the root cause of these disruptions.

Could you please schedule a detailed inspection or possibly provide insights remotely? We are also open to discussing potential upgrades or configuration adjustments to mitigate this issue. Kindly treat this as urgent and inform us of the next steps at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.
