To help resolve the crashing issue, please try the following steps:

1. Ensure your system meets all of Photoshop's requirements.
2. Disable any third-party plugins and gradually re-enable them after checking the application's stability.
3. Reset Photoshop's preferences by holding Ctrl + Alt + Shift (Windows) or Command + Option + Shift (Mac) upon starting the application.
4. Run Photoshop as an administrator and check for permissions issues that might affect its performance.
5. If the problem persists, check Adobe's website or contact their support for any patches or updates specifically addressing these crashes.
