Subject: Connection Issues with Zoom Application
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Hello Customer Support,

I am writing to report ongoing connection issues with Zoom 5.11.0 on my system. During video conferences, I frequently experience intermittent audio cuts, which significantly disrupt communication. My internet connection appears stable, so I suspect there might be a compatibility or software glitch causing this problem. Please provide guidance on troubleshooting this issue or if there are updates available that address these connectivity concerns. Any assistance you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your prompt attention.

Best regards,
