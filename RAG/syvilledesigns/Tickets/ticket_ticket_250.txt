Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a concerning issue I have been experiencing with my Dell XPS 13 9310 laptop that I purchased from your store. Recently, the device display started flickering unexpectedly, and this issue has grown more frequent over the past few weeks, significantly affecting my productivity and user experience.

Given that the flickering of the display seems to suggest a potential hardware malfunction, I am hoping to leverage the warranty service for assistance. I have tried basic troubleshooting steps such as updating the display drivers and ensuring all software on my device is up to date, but unfortunately, these steps have not resolved the issue.

Furthermore, this laptop is still well within the warranty period offered by Dell and your store, since it was purchased less than six months ago. Therefore, I kindly request guidance on how to process this complaint through warranty service. I am particularly interested in knowing what steps I should undertake next, and whether I would need to send the laptop to your service center, or if there could be an alternative resolution.

Moreover, please let me know if additional documentation is required from my end to expedite the claim or any information concerning my purchase details. My order number is <order_num>, and I bought this laptop on <purchase_date>. The laptopâ€™s serial number is <serial_num>. Please contact me at your earliest convenience through my email or at <tel_num> should you need further information.

Thank you in advance for your prompt assistance in this matter. I look forward to resolving this issue swiftly with your help.

Warm regards,
