Thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about the issues with your MacBook Air M1. To address the unexpected shutdowns and battery drain, try the following steps:

1. Update macOS to the latest version to ensure all recent bug fixes are applied.
2. Reset the System Management Controller (SMC) and PRAM/NVRAM.
3. Check for any resource-intensive applications running in the background.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, please contact an Apple Authorized Service Provider. We recommend backing up any important data before a service visit. Let us know if you need further help!

Best regards,
