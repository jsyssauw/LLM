Subject: Billing Discrepancy
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to address a billing discrepancy I've encountered concerning the recent renewal of my Microsoft Office 365 subscription. The renewal appears on my billing statement dated the 6th of October, 2023. Upon reviewing the charges, I noticed a difference in the amount billed compared to the agreed pricing at the time of subscription. Initially, my contract indicated an annual renewal fee of $69.99, but this latest charge is $89.99.

For clarity, my account number is <acc_num>, and the affected product is Microsoft Office 365. I would appreciate it if you could investigate this matter at your earliest convenience to correct any possible errors. I am eager to continue utilizing this service without interruptions and ensure all billing aligns with my original agreement.

Please don't hesitate to contact me at <email> or <tel_num> should further information be required. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your swift resolution.

Kind regards,

<name>
