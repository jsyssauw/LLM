Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request an upgrade of our Google Workspace licenses for the sales team to enhance their productivity and collaboration capabilities. Currently, we are using the Business Standard edition, and a transition to a more advanced plan would highly benefit our team. Please let us know the procedures and costs associated with this upgrade.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
