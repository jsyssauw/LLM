Subject: Request for AWS Infrastructure Changes
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

My name is <name>, and I am writing to request a review and potential modification of our current AWS deployment infrastructures managed under the AWS Management Service. Due to escalating costs, we are interested in exploring options aimed at optimizing our current cloud computing setup, specifically for better cost efficiency.

While we have utilized several services effectively, a recent audit highlighted areas where adjustments could lead to significant cost reductions without impacting performance. We are particularly interested in understanding better the segmentation and scaling options that can be applied within our AWS framework.

Could someone from your team assist us in conducting a comprehensive analysis? We also hope to schedule a consultation to discuss our current setup and potential cost-saving strategies at the earliest possible convenience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Looking forward to your prompt response.

Kind regards,

<name>
