Subject: Wi-Fi Connection Instability Using TP-Link EAP245 in Congestion
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Hello Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about an issue we are experiencing with the TP-Link EAP245 access points under high congestion areas. While using this model, users report unstable Wi-Fi connections, which is causing disruptions, notably during peak usage times.

Our network setup usually maintains high performance; however, in busy environments such as conference rooms or open-plan offices, maintaining a stable connection becomes challenging. The inconsistency negatively impacts productivity and overall user satisfaction.

Could you please provide guidance on potential solutions or optimizations to better handle high-density environments? We are eager to resolve this issue promptly to ensure seamless network connectivity for users.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Customer Service answer: Hello <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the instability with your TP-Link EAP245 in high congestion areas. To improve Wi-Fi performance in dense environments, please consider the following solutions:

1. Enable band steering to allow devices to use the 5GHz band more efficiently.
2. Adjust the channel width, possibly reducing it to 20MHz to lower interference.
3. Increase the number of APs to distribute the load more evenly.
4. Use load balancing to manage the number of clients per access point.
5. Update the firmware of your devices to the latest version for optimal performance.
6. Implement QoS settings to prioritize critical traffic.

If the issue persists, please let us know for further assistance.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
