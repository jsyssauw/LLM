Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your internet connectivity issues with the Cisco Router ISR4331. We understand how frustrating frequent disconnections can be.

Please ensure that your router's firmware is up to date, as this can often resolve stability issues. You can check for firmware updates on the Cisco website. If the problem persists even after updating, try isolating the router from any environmental interference by placing it in a centralized, open location.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, it may be necessary to perform a factory reset on your router or replace faulty hardware. We can assist you with further diagnostics remotely or arrange for a technician visit if necessary.

Please contact us at your convenience to proceed with these steps or for additional support.

Thank you for reaching out.

Best regards,
IT Services Customer Support
