Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for contacting us about the display flickering issue on your Dell XPS 13 model 9310. I understand how this can impact your productivity and am here to assist you.

Firstly, since you've already tried updating the drivers and adjusting settings without success, we recommend checking if any firmware updates are available for your device, as these can sometimes resolve common issues.

As your laptop is less than a year old, it should still be covered under warranty. Please proceed by contacting Dell Support directly to arrange for a warranty evaluation or repair service. They can guide you through additional troubleshooting steps, or if necessary, set up a service request.

For immediate steps, you can also try connecting your laptop to an external monitor to determine if the flickering appears there as well. This could help ascertain whether the issue is with the display or an internal component.

Should you need further assistance, feel free to reach out. We aim to get you back up and running swiftly.

Best regards,

Service Desk Agent
