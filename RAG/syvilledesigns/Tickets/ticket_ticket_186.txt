The steps involved typically include:
1. Initial Consultation: Understanding your organizational goals and specific needs.
2. Assessment: Comprehensive review of your existing server and IT infrastructure.
3. Recommendation: Development of a customized plan focusing on modernization, security, and optimization.
4. Implementation: Step-by-step execution of the strategic plan within agreed timelines.
5. Evaluation: Continuous monitoring and fine-tuning for maximal performance.

Timelines for these phases can vary based on the complexity and scope of your requirements. We can provide a more detailed timeframe once we understand more about your current setup and goals.

Regarding costs, our consulting services are typically structured based on the scope of work and required resources. We are happy to provide a tailored quote after the initial consultation.
