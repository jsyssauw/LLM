Subject: Billing Structure Change Request
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support, 

I am writing to request a change in the billing structure for the AWS Management Service where my account number is <acc_num>. As we are currently experiencing an increase in usage during our deployment phases, we need a billing model that can better accommodate this extended usage. Presently, our costs have exceeded usual limits, impacting our budget significantly. 

For any necessary discussions or clarifications, please feel free to reach me at <tel_num> or email at <email>. I look forward to your support in modifying our agreement to cater to our specific requirements during these intense periods of deployment.

Thank you.

Kind regards,
<name>
