We are writing to report an issue with the Jira Software version 8.20 being experienced by numerous users within our organization. During peak hours, users are facing significantly delayed response times when attempting to use the project management interface. As you can understand, this delay is decreasing our team's productivity and causing considerable inconvenience. We would like to request your urgent assistance in investigating and resolving this issue.

It seems the problem primarily occurs in high traffic periods, which might suggest the need for performance optimization, perhaps due to server load or configuration constraints.

Please let us know if further details or logs from our end would help in diagnosing the issue. 

Your prompt response and support would be highly appreciated, as our team relies heavily on Jira for coordinating our project tasks. We are hopeful for a swift resolution to maintain our workflow uninterrupted.
