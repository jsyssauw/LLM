Subject: Issues with Wireless Connectivity on Canon PIXMA
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue that I've been experiencing with my Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer, particularly related to wireless connectivity when setting it up on my home network. I recently purchased this printer from your store, and from the beginning, the setup process has been quite challenging. The printer consistently fails to connect to my home Wi-Fi network, which obviously hinders any printing tasks I wish to carry out wirelessly.

I've gone over the setup instructions multiple times, ensured that my router settings are compatible and even attempted various troubleshooting steps such as restarting my modem and the printer, altering firewall settings, and checking my Wi-Fi credentials. However, the problem persists, and the printer refuses to establish a stable connection.

I would appreciate any guidance or support documentation you might offer to help resolve this connectivity issue. If there is a known issue or update that might rectify this problem, kindly let me know at your earliest convenience. Your prompt assistance in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Best regards,
