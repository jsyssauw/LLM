Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request assistance with setting up Scrum boards in Jira Software 8.20. We are aiming to enhance our project management efficiency and believe that utilizing Scrum boards would significantly benefit our workflow. 

Currently, we've encountered some challenges in configuring the boards to align with our project requirements and ensure seamless integration with the existing processes. Since we are relatively new to using Jira Software, we would appreciate step-by-step guidance on how to optimize the settings and features tailored to meet the projectâ€™s needs. 

Could you please provide us with detailed instructions or any available resources such as guides or tutorials that could assist us in this setup process? If possible, we would also like to schedule a call with one of your support specialists for personalized advice. 

Thank you for your attention and support in this matter. We look forward to your prompt response. 

Best regards,
