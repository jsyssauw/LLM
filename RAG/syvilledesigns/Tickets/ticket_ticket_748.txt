Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you about an issue I am experiencing with my Dell XPS 13 9310 laptop, which I purchased from your store. The laptop tends to overheat during regular use, resulting in a significant degradation in performance. This issue started occurring about two weeks ago and has progressively gotten worse.

The model number of the laptop is Dell XPS 13 9310. Despite trying various troubleshooting steps myself, such as cleaning the vents, updating the drivers, and using a cooling pad, the laptop continues to overheat after short periods of typical usage.

Given that this device is critical for my work, the performance dips are causing considerable inconvenience. I am reaching out to request support in resolving this matter as swiftly as possible. I would appreciate guidance on the next steps I should take, whether it involves bringing the laptop to an authorized service center or having a technician review the issue online.

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
