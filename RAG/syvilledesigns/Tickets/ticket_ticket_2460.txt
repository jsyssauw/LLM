Subject: Touchscreen Issue with Surface Pro 7
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Hello Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern regarding an ongoing issue I am experiencing with a product purchased from your store. The product in question is a Microsoft Surface Pro 7, a 2-in-1 Windows 10 device with a detachable keyboard. Unfortunately, the touchscreen, a crucial feature of this device, has become unresponsive, which significantly hampers its usability.

I have already attempted several basic troubleshooting steps, such as restarting the device and checking for available software updates, to no avail. Additionally, I ensured that there were no obstructions such as dirt or damage on the screen, which could potentially cause this problem.

For verification purposes, my order number is <acc_num>, and I purchased the device on <purchase_date>. It is concerning that such an issue has arisen within a short period of ownership, and I am seeking your guidance on the possible steps to rectify this.

I kindly request that you advise on whether this is a known issue and if there might be specific troubleshooting steps I could follow. Alternatively, let me know if the device can be repaired or replaced under warranty.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your reply. You can reach me at <email> or <tel_num> for any further information you may require.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
<name>
