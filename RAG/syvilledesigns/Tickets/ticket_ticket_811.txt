Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report a minor glitch I've been experiencing with my MacBook Air M1, which I purchased recently from your store. I've observed that when the device wakes up from sleep mode after a relatively short time being idle, it occasionally does not respond with the usual speed and efficiency. This issue manifests mainly after brief periods of inactivity, roughly around 5 to 10 minutes. However, I haven't noticed this problem occurring after more extended sleep durations. 

This issue has not yet severely impacted my productivity, but I would like to understand if this is a common issue and whether there are any recommended solutions or patches for it. I rely heavily on my MacBook for daily tasks, and while it's not a major hindrance for now, I want to ensure that it won't develop into a significant problem later on. 

Thank you very much for your assistance and support. I look forward to your feedback and any possible solutions you may suggest. 

Best regards,
<name>
