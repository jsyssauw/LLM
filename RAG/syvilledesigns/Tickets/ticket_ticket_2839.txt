Subject: Issue with DJI Phantom 4 Pro Drone
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to report a malfunction with the DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone I purchased last month from Tech Online Store. During flight, the camera begins to experience significant issues, resulting in an unstable video feed and inconsistent drone performance. This occurs sporadically, but often enough that it disrupts the usability and enjoyment of the device. Prior to the malfunction, the drone operated exceptionally well with no noticeable issues. To resolve this, I have attempted recalibrating the camera settings and updating the firmware, but unfortunately the problem persists. For your reference, my order number is <acc_num>. I am seeking guidance on potential troubleshooting steps I may have missed or to inquire about the possibility of a replacement or repair under warranty. Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please advise on the next steps at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Kind regards,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for contacting us regarding the issue with your DJI Phantom 4 Pro drone. We apologize for the inconvenience caused and are here to assist you.

Given the attempts you have already made, such as recalibrating the camera settings and updating the firmware, we recommend trying a few additional troubleshooting steps:
1. Check for any loose connections in the camera assembly.
2. Ensure that the camera lens and sensors are clean and free from obstructions.
3. Perform a full factory reset on the drone to rule out any software glitches.

If the problem persists after these steps, it is likely a hardware issue. Since your DJI Phantom 4 Pro is still under warranty based on the purchase date, you can proceed with a warranty claim. We suggest the following:
- Contact Tech Online Store directly regarding their warranty policy, as they may offer a replacement or repair.
- Alternatively, reach out to DJI Support with your proof of purchase and order number <acc_num> to inquire about repair or replacement options.

Please let us know if you require any further support or have difficulties with the warranty process. We are here to ensure you receive the assistance you need.

Best regards,

Customer Support Team
