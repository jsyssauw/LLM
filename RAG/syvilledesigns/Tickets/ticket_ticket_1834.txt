Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I am writing to request clarification on the annual renewal charges for Microsoft Office 365 that recently appeared on my account statement. My name is <name>, and my account number is <acc_num>. Upon reviewing my latest statement, I noticed an unexpected charge related to Microsoft Office 365 renewal that I do not recall authorizing or having prior notification about.

If there have been any changes to the subscription terms or pricing, I would appreciate being provided with that information. Additionally, if this charge was an error, I would like to know the steps to adjust my statement accordingly.

Please reach out to me directly at <tel_num> or respond to this email at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your attention to this matter and for providing clarity on this issue.
