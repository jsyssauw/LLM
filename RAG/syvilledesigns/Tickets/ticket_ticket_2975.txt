Subject: Help Needed: Screen Flickering Problem
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Hello Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I am reaching out to communicate a problem I've encountered with my Dell XPS 13 laptop, model 9310, which I bought a few months back from your store. Lately, I have observed that the screen flickers erratically, especially when I frequently change the brightness levels during use. This has created considerable disruption to my work and has been straining to my eyesight.

I have attempted several basic troubleshooting techniques, such as updating the device drivers and confirming that the operating system is current; however, these steps did not fix the issue. I've also inspected the physical connections, which all appear secure.

Given that this problem persists, I am requesting guidance on what steps I should take next. Should I carry the laptop to one of your service locations for assessment, or is there an option for receiving assistance remotely? Additionally, I would like to know if this issue falls under the warranty coverage of my purchase.

Could you kindly inform me of the necessary documentation I need to bring, along with any additional instructions? I would prefer to sort this matter out promptly so I can use the laptop efficiently for my work.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
