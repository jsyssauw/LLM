Thank you for reaching out regarding your TP-Link EAP245 connectivity issue. To help resolve potential wireless interference, try changing the channel settings on both frequency bands within your access point's management interface. Additionally, ensure the firmware is up to date as updates can enhance performance. If the issue persists, resetting the device to factory settings may also help.
