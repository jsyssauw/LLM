Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with Google Chrome version 102.0. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the crashes:

1. Ensure Chrome is fully updated by going to 'Settings' -> 'About Chrome' to check for updates.
2. Clear your browsing data by clicking on 'Settings' -> 'Privacy and Security' -> 'Clear browsing data'.
3. Disable any unnecessary extensions by visiting 'chrome://extensions/'.
4. Consider resetting Chrome settings to default by going to 'Settings' -> 'Advanced' -> 'Restore settings to their original defaults'.

If none of these solutions work, a potential temporary workaround is to use an alternate browser like Firefox or Edge for critical tasks while a fix is potentially being developed for the version you're using.

Feel free to provide more details about your setup if the issue persists. We are here to ensure your browsing experience returns to optimal status.

Best regards,

Customer Support Team
