Subject: Intermittent Screen Flickering Issue on Laptop
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to report an issue with my recently purchased laptop, the Dell XPS 13 9310, which has been exhibiting intermittent screen flickering during regular use. This issue becomes more apparent and frequent whenever I adjust its brightness settings.

I purchased the laptop recently through your online store using order number <order_num>, and it is still under warranty. Initially, the performance was flawless, but over the last few weeks, I've noticed an increasing amount of screen flickering that is severely hindering my productivity, especially during conference calls and presentations.

I have tried a number of troubleshooting steps, such as updating the display drivers, performing system updates, and resetting the brightness settings to automatic, but the issue persists. I've also attempted to disable adaptive brightness features and experimented with different power settings, but unfortunately, these attempts have not resolved the problem.

Given that this is a high-performance model, I was expecting seamless use, but this problem is a substantial disappoint. Therefore, I request your guidance on how to move forward with getting this issue fixed. I look forward to your recommendations or arranging for a repair or replacement if required.

Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. Please contact me at your earliest convenience at <email> or via my mobile number, <tel_num>.

Warm regards,
<name>
