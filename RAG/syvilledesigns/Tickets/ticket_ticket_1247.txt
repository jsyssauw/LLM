Hello <name>,

I'm here to help with your HP DeskJet 3755 printer WiFi setup. First, ensure your printer is within range of your WiFi router. Check that WiFi Direct is enabled on your printer and your router's password is entered correctly. Download the HP Smart app, it can guide the setup. If issues persist, restart the printer, router, and your device, then attempt the connection again. For persistent issues, please contact HP support.

Best regards,
<Service Desk Agent>
