Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding an issue we are experiencing with our networking equipment, particularly the Cisco Router ISR4331 with serial number <ser_num>. Over the past few weeks, we have encountered intermittent connectivity issues that are significantly affecting our operations. We have verified that our internal network configuration has not changed, leading us to suspect potential issues with the router's configuration or a need for firmware updates. 

Given that stability is crucial for our daily activities, it is imperative that we resolve this issue as soon as possible. I would appreciate it if your technical support team could assist us by examining the current configuration of our Cisco Router ISR4331 and advising on any necessary adjustments. We also want to ensure that the firmware version is up to date, as we suspect this might play a role in the connectivity disruptions. 

Please let us know the steps we can take to facilitate a remote troubleshooting session, or if you require us to bring the router in for inspection. Our team is readily available to provide any additional information you might need, including detailed logs or specific event times. You can contact me via email or at <tel_num> during our office hours, and I shall make sure to provide any assistance required from our end. 

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. We look forward to working closely with your technical team to rectify this issue. Should you need to reach out directly, feel free to contact <name> at <email>.
