Subject: Request for Review: Incorrect Monthly Charge
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern regarding a billing issue with my recent Google Workspace Business Standard plan. My account number, <acc_num>, was charged incorrectly in the latest billing cycle, which led to an unexpected charge.

Despite having a standard monthly billing agreement, the invoice amount from last period indicates a considerable discrepancy. Kindly review the billing details associated with my account and advise on the necessary adjustments. Attached is the screenshot of the invoice for your review. I believe this issue requires urgent attention to avoid future discrepancies.

Please respond at your earliest convenience so we can resolve this matter promptly. Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
