Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek assistance regarding an issue I am experiencing with my Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Recently, the touchscreen has become non-responsive, severely impacting my ability to use the device effectively.
