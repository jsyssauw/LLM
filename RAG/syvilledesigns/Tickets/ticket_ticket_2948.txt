Customer Issue: Greetings Customer Support, I hope this message reaches you in good spirits. I am reaching out to request a return or exchange due to an issue I am facing with the Canon PIXMA MG3620 that was purchased from your Tech Online Store. Regrettably, the printer is producing paper jams every time I try duplex printing. I have attempted to troubleshoot the unit in accordance with the instructions in the manual, but the issue persists. Given that this problem hinders the use of the printer for its intended purpose, I kindly seek your guidance on how to proceed with returning or exchanging this item. I anticipate your swift assistance in addressing this concern. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Kind regards, <name>.
