Subject: Power Button Issue on Dell XPS
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to report an issue with my laptop that I purchased from your store. The device in question is a Dell XPS 13 9310. I am having trouble with the power button not responding, which is preventing the device from starting up altogether.

I have attempted some basic troubleshooting steps such as plugging the laptop into a power source to ensure the battery is not dead, but unfortunately, none of these methods have successfully resolved the issue. This laptop is crucial for my daily operations and I would appreciate your prompt assistance in resolving this matter.

Could you please advise on the next steps? Should I take the device to a local technician affiliated with your company, or would it be possible to send it back to your center for further inspection? I have tried reaching out through your helpline at <tel_num> but was unable to reach an operator. My account number is <acc_num> and I hope this can help expedite the process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your swift response to ensure minimal disruption to my work. Please let me know if any additional information is required.

Sincerely,

<name>
