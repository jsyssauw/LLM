Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue we are facing with Jira Software 8.20. Our users are currently unable to log in due to a server error that appears directly on the login screen. This error has been persistent since yesterday and is affecting our productivity significantly as many team members rely on Jira for project management tasks.

We have tried clearing the cache and even accessing it via different browsers, but the problem persists. Could you please assist us with troubleshooting this server problem? Any guidance or timeframe for resolution would be greatly appreciated, as our work critically depends on seamless access to Jira Software.

Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
