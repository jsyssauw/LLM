Subject: Help Requested for Dell XPS 13 Startup Issues
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek assistance with my Dell XPS 13 9310, which has been experiencing startup issues following a recent operating system update. The laptop fails to boot properly and gets stuck during the startup process. I have tried basic troubleshooting steps such as rebooting in safe mode and performing a system restore, but unfortunately, these actions have not resolved the problem. 

Please advise on any further measures I can take to address this situation or if a service appointment is necessary. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. My case reference number is <ref_num>.

Best regards,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. We're sorry to hear about the startup issues with your Dell XPS 13 9310. Since you've already attempted safe mode and system restore, we recommend trying a full hardware diagnostic using the built-in Dell SupportAssist. If the issue persists, it might be necessary to reinstall the operating system. Please back up your data first. If these steps do not help, scheduling a service appointment would be advisable. Please let us know if you need further assistance.
