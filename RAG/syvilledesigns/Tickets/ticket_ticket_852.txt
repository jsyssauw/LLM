Subject: Need Assistance: Dell XPS 13 9310 Warranty Issue
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support, 

I am writing to report a screen flickering issue I am experiencing with my Dell XPS 13 9310 laptop. The problem began recently and has persisted, affecting the usability significantly. As this product is still covered under warranty, I am seeking immediate technical support to resolve the issue. 

The laptop was purchased in May 2023, and it has been maintained following the recommended guidelines from both Dell and your store. I believe the issue could be hardware-related, considering the flickering is present during various operations, regardless of software resets or driver updates. 

Could you kindly assist in arranging a diagnostic and repair, possibly through a warranty claim? My details for this request have been attached, including a copy of my purchase receipt showing the warranty coverage details. 

Please advise on the next steps for resolution. I can be reached via email or my contact number <tel_num> at your earliest convenience. Looking forward to your prompt support on this matter.

Thank you. 

Best regards,
