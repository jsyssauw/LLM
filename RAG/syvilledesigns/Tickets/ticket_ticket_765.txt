Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a connectivity issue I am experiencing with my HP DeskJet 3755 printer. The printer seems to have persistent problems when attempting to connect to my Wi-Fi network, which has resulted in being unable to execute any printing tasks. 

I am aware that the HP DeskJet 3755 is designed with wireless capabilities, and previously, it performed very well without such disruptions. However, recently, it fails to maintain a stable connection or recognize the network altogether. I have tried restarting both the printer and my Wi-Fi router, but the problem persists. 

Could you please assist me in troubleshooting this issue? I would appreciate any guidance or steps you could provide to help resolve this situation. Alternatively, if the problem relates to technical defects, I would kindly request information regarding any available warranty service. I purchased this printer to enhance productivity, and I am keen to restore its functionality. 

Thank you for your attention and prompt response to this matter. 

Sincerely,
