Subject: Invoice Concern Regarding MySQL Acquisition
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Esteemed Tech Online Store Support Team,

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am reaching out to resolve a billing issue concerning my recent acquisition from your shop. Upon reviewing my account, I discovered that I had been billed twice for the MySQL 8.0.30 database software, which I actually purchased only once.

The transaction specifics are as follows: account number <acc_num> for MySQL 8.0.30, with the transaction date being [insert date]. While my store account shows just one successful transaction, my linked payment method indicates two charges of the identical amount; this has resulted in an unplanned withdrawal from my account balance.

Could you kindly look into this issue and process a refund for the additional charge at your earliest ease? I have attached a screenshot of the transaction statement which illustrates the duplicated charge.

Please feel free to get in touch with me at your convenience. You can contact me via email or at <tel_num>. I am grateful for your swift attention to this matter and hope to see it resolved shortly.

Thank you for your comprehension and support.

Yours sincerely,
