Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out about the issues with your Cisco ISR4331 Router. Frequent disconnections and slow performance can often be resolved through firmware updates or configuration adjustments. Please ensure the router firmware is up-to-date. You can download the latest updates from Ciscoâ€™s official website. Additionally, check the router's configuration settings for any anomalies.

If the problem persists, I recommend performing a factory reset and re-configuring the settings. You might also consider reaching out to a certified Cisco technician for an in-depth analysis.

Feel free to contact us for further assistance. We're here to help restore your operations promptly.

Best regards,
[Your Support Team]
