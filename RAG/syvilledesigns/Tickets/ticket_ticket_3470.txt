Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out with your concern regarding the performance issues with MySQL 8.0.30. We understand the impact this is having on your operations and are here to assist you.

To address the slow response times, please ensure that not only the queries are optimized, but also check the status of the database indices, which can significantly affect performance. If you have not already done so, consider reviewing the configuration options for the MySQL server to ensure they are set for optimal performance relevant to your workload, such as buffer sizes and connection limits.

Additionally, examine any server logs or error messages for potential sources of the slowdown. Upgrading to a newer version of MySQL could also address unforeseen bugs that might be causing the issue.

If further personalized assistance is needed, please let us know, and we can schedule a session with our technical specialist to dive deeper into the issue.

We appreciate your patience and are committed to resolving this matter swiftly.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
