Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support,

I am writing to report a persistent issue with my Microsoft Surface Pro 7, which was purchased on account number <acc_num>. For the past week, I have experienced frequent screen flickering and an unresponsive touchscreen. The issue severely affects usability and productivity. Attempts to troubleshoot, including software updates and hard resets, have not resolved the problems.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.
