Subject: Issues with Epson EcoTank ET-4760 Printer
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concerns regarding the Epson EcoTank ET-4760 printer that I purchased from your store. Initially, the printer performed excellently, but over the past month, I have encountered substantial issues affecting its functionality. 

Firstly, the printer has shown abnormal ink consumption rates. The ink levels deplete much faster compared to my previous experiences and I havenâ€™t increased my typical printing volume. Secondly, the Wi-Fi connectivity has become erratic, making it challenging to execute print jobs efficiently. Sometimes, it fails to connect to the network at all, requiring multiple restarts to reestablish the connection. 

I kindly request guidance on troubleshooting these issues, or if necessary, returning the product for repair or replacement. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know how I should proceed. 

Best regards,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the issues with your Epson EcoTank ET-4760 printer. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.

To address the ink consumption issue, please ensure that your printer's firmware is up to date and perform a print head nozzle check, as clogs can increase ink usage. For Wi-Fi connectivity problems, try moving the printer closer to your router and resetting your network settings on the printer.

If these troubleshooting steps do not resolve the issues, we are here to assist you further. You can consider bringing in the printer for our technicians to diagnose it, or we can discuss options regarding repair or replacement.

Please contact us at your earliest convenience to arrange the next steps.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
