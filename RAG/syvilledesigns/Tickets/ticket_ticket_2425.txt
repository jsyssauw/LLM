Subject: Requesting Assistance for Printer Paper Jam Error
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Hello Customer Support Team,

I am experiencing a continuous issue with my Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer. Whenever I attempt to utilize the all-in-one wireless printing functionality, a paper jam error repeatedly occurs, making it impossible to proceed with my printing tasks. Despite several attempts to resolve this on my own, the error persists.

I purchased this printer a few months ago from your Tech Online Store and have been encountering this problem ever since. Could you please provide guidance on how to troubleshoot this issue or facilitate a replacement if necessary?

I appreciate your prompt assistance in this matter as it is affecting my daily work tasks. Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
