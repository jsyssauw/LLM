Subject: Request for Detailed Billing Clarification
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern and seek clarification regarding some discrepancies I have found in my recent billing statement for my Microsoft Office 365 subscription. Upon reviewing the charges associated with account number <acc_num>, I have noticed several entries that I do not fully understand and need a detailed breakdown to ensure everything is accurate.

In particular, it would be very helpful if you could provide me with an itemized list of all charges applied to my subscription this billing cycle. Additionally, I would like clarity on any taxes or fees that have been included, as these figures were not anticipated in the initial agreement.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am keen to resolve this as soon as possible, so I would appreciate a prompt response. Should you need to contact me for further information, please feel free to reach out via email or phone at <tel_num>.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
