Subject: Request to upgrade IntelliJ IDEA for improved features
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request an upgrade for our current IntelliJ IDEA installation to the latest version, IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1. We have been experiencing some limitations with our existing setup, particularly concerning code completion and refactoring capabilities, which are crucial to our ongoing projects.

After reviewing the new features introduced in the latest release, it is evident that upgrading could significantly enhance the productivity and efficiency of our development team. The advanced features promised, such as better code analysis, more robust refactoring options, and improved integration with various frameworks, are precisely what we are looking to leverage.

Could you please provide guidance on the upgrade process? Additionally, if there are any associated costs or potential hurdles we should be aware of, kindly let us know at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your attention to this request. I look forward to your prompt response so we can swiftly proceed with the upgrade.

Best regards,
