Subject: Urgent Invoice Clarification Needed for IT Services
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

My name is <name> and my account number is <acc_num>. I am writing to request urgent clarification regarding an invoice I received for the IT consulting services provided last month. The details on the invoice appear to be inconsistent with the initial agreement and my understanding of the services delivered.

We engaged your IT Consulting Service to enhance our company's IT infrastructure from <date1> to <date2>. While I trust the quality of your services, I have some concerns regarding certain charges listed on the invoice dated <date3>, invoice number <inv_num>. Specifically, the breakdown of additional support hours and materials costs seem higher than we initially discussed during the consultation phase.

Furthermore, I would appreciate a detailed explanation of the consulting hours accounted for, as the summary in the invoice indicates a significantly higher figure than what our internal records show. Could you kindly review the associated charges and provide a comprehensive clarification or a corrected invoice if necessary? It is crucial for our financial accountability and budget planning to ensure our records align with your billing.

I understand that errors can occur, and I seek to resolve this matter promptly. Thus, a swift clarification would be greatly appreciated to maintain our positive business relationship. If needed, I am available to discuss this over the phone at <tel_num> during business hours, or you can email me at my registered address with your company.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Warm regards,
