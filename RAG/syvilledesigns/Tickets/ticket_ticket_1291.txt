Subject: Request to Exchange Microsoft Surface Pro 7 Due to Malfunction
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: "Dear Tech Online Store Support Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request an exchange for a recently purchased Microsoft Surface Pro 7, due to a malfunctioning touch screen. Upon receiving and setting up the device, I noticed that the touch screen is unresponsive at times, which greatly hinders my workflow and productivity. Given the quality and the price point of the Surface Pro 7, I anticipate a flawless experience, and unfortunately, that has not been the case. I kindly ask for guidance on your exchange process to replace my current device with a fully functioning unit under the warranty terms. The order was placed on your website and delivered to my address at 123 Tech Avenue. My order number is <order_num>. Additionally, could you please confirm any shipping details that I need to address for the return of the defective product? Thank you in advance for your prompt assistance. I look forward to resolving this issue swiftly and receiving the replacement device soon. Kind regards, <name> <tel_num> <email_address>"
