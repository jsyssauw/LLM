Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you've experienced with the touchscreen settings on your Microsoft Surface Pro 7. To better assist you, please try the following steps:

1. Ensure that your device's touchscreen drivers are up to date. You can do this by going to Device Manager, finding the 'Human Interface Devices', and checking the driver status for your touchscreen.

2. Calibrate your touchscreen through the Control Panel under 'Tablet PC Settings'.

3. Perform a clean boot to rule out any software conflicts. Instructions for doing a clean boot can typically be found in the Support section of the Microsoft website.

If the issue still persists, we can arrange a remote support session for further assistance. Please provide a convenient time for you, and our technician can guide you through the process.

Feel free to call our support team at <tel_num> if you prefer to discuss this over the phone. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Best regards,

Tech Online Store Customer Support Team
