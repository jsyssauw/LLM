Subject: High CPU Usage Issue: Dell XPS 13 9310
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to bring to your attention a critical issue I am experiencing with my Dell XPS 13 9310 laptop purchased from your Tech Online Store. The device exhibits consistently high CPU usage, even during light tasks, resulting in system overheating, which makes it uncomfortable and concerning to use for extended periods. Additionally, this high CPU activity has led to random shutdowns, severely impacting the performance and reliability I expect from a high-end model.

The laptop, despite recent updates and minimal software installations, struggles to maintain optimal performance. This situation is causing significant distress, as it affects both productivity and extends downtime, neither of which is acceptable.

Given the nature of this issue, I would appreciate it if you could provide guidance on potential fixes or recommendations on how to proceed, including an evaluation for a possible repair or replacement under warranty. This defect heavily impacts my user experience, necessitating a timely resolution.

I look forward to your prompt response to help resolve this issue. Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

Best regards,
