Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support team, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek assistance with configuring filters in Jira Software version 8.20 to enhance our project tracking and management in our Agile teams. We are facing challenges in streamlining our workflow, and I believe that improving the filters setup would significantly improve our monitoring and reporting capabilities. Could you please provide detailed guidance or resources that could assist us in optimizing the Jira filters? Any templates or examples of commonly used filters in Agile project frameworks would also be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your support and expertise. Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. To configure filters in Jira Software version 8.20 for enhanced project tracking and management, you can start by accessing the "Filters" menu in the header and selecting "Advanced issue search." Use JQL (Jira Query Language) for customizing your filters. Common filters include those for "Issues Due Soon," "Open Bugs," and "Sprints in Progress." For Agile teams, focus on Epic tracking and Sprint completion. Documentation and video tutorials on the Atlassian website provide step-by-step guidance. If you need specific templates, let us know.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
