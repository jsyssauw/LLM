I am writing to urgently request clarification on the recent invoice we received regarding AWS Management Service. It appears there are discrepancies in the charges labeled as "Service Fees." These unexplained fees are impacting our budget planning.

Additionally, we have previously communicated concerns about outstanding payment issues on our account <acc_num>, which seem to remain unresolved. Could you please provide detailed information and a resolution plan at your earliest convenience?

We value our relationship with IT Services and hope to continue our partnership effectively.

Please contact me directly at <tel_num> for any further information.
