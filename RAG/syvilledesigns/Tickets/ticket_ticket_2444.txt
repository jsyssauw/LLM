Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Hello Tech Online Store Support Team,

I am reaching out to convey my unease regarding the connectivity problems I've been having with my Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer, particularly with its mobile printing capability. I have adhered to all the given guidelines, such as confirming that the printer is on the same wireless network as my mobile device and making sure that the Canon PRINT application is fully updated.

Despite my best efforts, I am unable to successfully print directly from my smartphone. The device appears in the app; however, shortly after I initiate a print job, it ceases to function and shows an error message. I have also rebooted both the printer and my mobile device, yet the situation remains unchanged.

Could you assist me by providing further troubleshooting advice or let me know if this is a recognized problem with a proposed fix? My account number is <acc_num> should you require access to the purchase information. Please feel free to contact me at <name>.<lastname>@email.com or via phone at <tel_num> for any support or additional questions.

I appreciate your swift attention to this issue.

Best regards,
