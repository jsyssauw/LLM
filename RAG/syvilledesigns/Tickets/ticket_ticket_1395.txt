Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your AWS server configuration. We understand the importance of optimizing your cloud infrastructure for improved scalability and performance. To address the slow response times and occasional downtime, we recommend the following best practices:

1. Scalability: Consider implementing AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust capacity. Also, make use of Amazon CloudFront to increase the speed and reduce load times.

2. Performance: Utilize Amazon RDS Read Replicas for read-heavy applications, and consider AWS Performance Monitoring tools like CloudWatch for gaining insights into potential issues.

3. Reliability: Deploy usage of AWS Elastic Load Balancing to spread incoming traffic across multiple targets.

For tailored recommendations, we suggest scheduling a consultation with our AWS specialist, who can assess your specific needs more thoroughly.

We are committed to helping you optimize your AWS infrastructure for improved performance and scalability. Please let us know if you need further assistance or would like to schedule an in-depth review.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
