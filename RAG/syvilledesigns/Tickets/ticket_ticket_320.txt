Subject: Paper Jam Issue with HP DeskJet 3755
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to report a persistent issue I am experiencing with my HP DeskJet 3755 printer, purchased from Tech Online Store. Every time I try to print more than one page, the printer jams during the second page printing sequence. I have already checked for and removed any visible obstructions within the printer and have ensured that I am using the appropriate paper type and size.

Despite these efforts, the issue remains unsolved. Could you please guide me through any further troubleshooting steps or advise if a replacement or repair is required? Thank you for your assistance in resolving this issue.

Kind regards,

1. Remove and reload the paper in the input tray ensuring it's aligned correctly.
2. Turn off the printer, disconnect it from the power source, wait for 60 seconds, then reconnect and turn it back on.
3. Run the printer's paper feed cleaning utility from its software.

If the issue persists, you may need to have the printer serviced. Please contact HP Support directly for further instructions or reach out to the retailer, Tech Online Store, for warranty or replacement options.
