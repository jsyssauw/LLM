Subject: Request for Exchange Due to Connectivity Issues
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently purchased an Epson EcoTank ET-4760 printer from your store under the account number <acc_num>. Unfortunately, I've been experiencing compatibility issues with my wireless network, making it impossible to connect the printer. This issue has rendered the printer unusable for my current setup.

As a loyal customer, I kindly ask for an exchange for a compatible printer model or advice on alternative solutions. Please let me know the next steps regarding the exchange process, as well as any shipping instructions.

Thank you for your understanding and swift attention to my request.

Best regards,
