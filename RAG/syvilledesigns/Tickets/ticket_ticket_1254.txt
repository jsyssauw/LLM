I hope this message finds you well. We are writing to draw attention to a critical issue we are experiencing with our Cisco Router, model ISR4331. Unfortunately, the connectivity has been intermittent, significantly affecting our enterprise network's efficacy and performance. Due to these disruptions, our daily operations have faced delays, impacting productivity and client service timelines.

We have attempted basic troubleshooting steps, such as resetting the router and ensuring all cables and connections are secure, yet the issue persists. Given the serial number <serial_num> of our router, we hope that the tech team might provide deeper insights or arrange a suitable replacement if needed.
