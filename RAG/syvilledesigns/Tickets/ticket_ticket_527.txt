Customer Issue: Dear Support Team,

I am writing to report a serious issue that we have been facing with Jira Software 8.20, specifically during our Scrum sprint management tasks. Our team has encountered persistent malfunctions that are significantly affecting productivity and project timelines. We experience unexpected crashes and slow responses when updating sprint boards or managing backlog tasks. This problem started occurring after the last update, and we urgently need a solution as it disrupts our workflow. We kindly request immediate assistance and a potential workaround while a more permanent fix is worked on. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Looking forward to your prompt response.
