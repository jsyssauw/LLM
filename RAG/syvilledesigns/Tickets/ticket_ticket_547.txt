2. **Auto-scaling**: Utilize auto-scaling to optimize resource use based on demand.
3. **EBS Volume Optimization**: Regularly review EBS volumes and snapshots and delete any unattached volumes.
4. **Use of AWS Cost Explorer**: Utilize this tool for analyzing usage patterns and identifying saving opportunities.
5. **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Leverage Trusted Advisor for recommendations based on best practices.
6. **Spot Instances**: Consider using spot instances for non-essential workloads to take advantage of cost savings.
