Subject: Discrepancies in Azure Billing This Month
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention some discrepancies I have noticed in the billing for my account <acc_num>. This month’s statement lists unexpected charges related to my Azure Cloud Management Assistance usage. However, these costs appear to extend beyond the anticipated access expenses we had planned.

Despite a thorough review of my usage patterns, I have not been able to identify any changes that would justify these additional costs. I would appreciate any insights your team could provide into the specific charges in question. Furthermore, I request an audit of this month’s invoice to ensure no errors have occurred.

Please let me know if any additional information is needed from my side to expedite this review. I look forward to your prompt response to resolve this matter and ensure clarity in our billing processes.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best Regards,
<name>
