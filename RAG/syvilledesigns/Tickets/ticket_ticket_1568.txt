I've been experiencing issues with Zoom since the latest update to version 5.11.0. When trying to start a video call, the application persistently crashes or freezes. Previously, I had no issues with Zoom, but after this update, these problems occur frequently.

The disruptions in service have significantly impeded my work efficiency. I am contacting you in hopes of obtaining guidance or a potential fix on the matter. Is there a recommended action plan or an upcoming patch that might resolve these issues?

Thank you in advance for your assistance. Please let me know as soon as possible if further information is required.
