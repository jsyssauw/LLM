Subject: Issue with audio consistency on Zoom 5.11.0
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to bring to your attention a problem I have encountered with audio consistency during my online meetings using Zoom version 5.11.0, which I purchased through your Tech Online Store. Despite the softwareâ€™s numerous excellent features, the audio issues have been quite persistent. 

More specifically, the audio intermittently cuts out, which significantly disrupts the flow of meetings and makes it particularly challenging to communicate effectively. I have attempted multiple solutions, such as verifying my internet connection and ensuring my microphone and speakers are functioning correctly, but the problem persists. I would appreciate any guidance or troubleshooting steps you could provide to resolve these issues. 

If necessary, I am willing to provide further details about my device specifications or conduct any suggested diagnostics. Please let me know how I can assist you further in addressing this matter. Thank you for your time and support.

Kind regards,
