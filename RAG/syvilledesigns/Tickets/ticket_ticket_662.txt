Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. To address your concerns about resource usage and operational costs, I suggest the following AWS Management Services strategies: 

1. Right-Sizing: Analyze your resource usage and adjust the size of your instances accordingly.
2. Implement Auto-scaling: This will align your service demand with resource usage dynamically.
3. Use Cost Explorer: For detailed billing insights that help identify and cut down unnecessary expenditure.
4. Reserved Instances: Commit to a consistent level of usage to gain discounts.

Let us know if you need further assistance.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
