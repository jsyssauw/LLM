Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us.

To improve the wireless connectivity of your Canon PIXMA MG3620, please try the following steps: 

1. Ensure your printer is within range of your Wi-Fi router and there's minimal interference from other devices.
2. Access the printer settings via the Canon IJ Network Tool on your computer.
3. Set your network to a 2.4GHz band if possible, as it usually offers better range.
4. Assign a static IP to the printer to help maintain a stable connection.
5. Update the printer's firmware using the Canon support website. 

If issues persist, consider resetting your network settings and re-configuring the wireless setup from scratch.

We hope this improves your connection. Feel free to contact us again if you need further assistance.

Best regards,
Tech Online Store Support
