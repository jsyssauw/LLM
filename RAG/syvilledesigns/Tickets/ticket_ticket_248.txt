Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request a return for an item purchased, the HP DeskJet 3755 printer, due to persistent issues. From the start, the printer has been experiencing frequent paper jams and significant wireless connectivity issues. These defects make it challenging to use the printer for any productive tasks, which has been quite frustrating.

I purchased this product from your online store under account number <acc_num> and have attempted basic troubleshooting steps as suggested in the manual. However, the issues persist, and I am unable to find a resolution.

I kindly request a return and refund for the mentioned item as it does not meet expected quality standards. Please let me know about the next steps to initiate this return. You can reach me at <tel_num> for any further details needed.

Thank you for your prompt assistance in resolving this matter.

Best regards,
<name>
