Subject: Request for more RAM options on Microsoft Surface Pro 7
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire if there are any additional RAM upgrade options available for the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 tablet. As a regular multitasker who relies extensively on this device for both personal and professional tasks, I find it crucial to have faster multitasking capabilities. Upgrading from the existing RAM could significantly improve my productivity. 

Could you please provide information on available upgrade solutions or alternative models that cater to such needs? Thank you for your assistance. 

Looking forward to your prompt response. 

Best regards,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for your inquiry regarding RAM upgrades for the Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Unfortunately, the Surface Pro 7 does not support RAM upgrades as the memory is soldered onto the motherboard. If you need more RAM for enhanced multitasking, you may consider alternative models like the Surface Pro 8 or Surface Pro X, which offer higher RAM configurations at the time of purchase. Please let us know if you need further assistance or details on our current models.

Best regards,
Tech Online Store Customer Support
