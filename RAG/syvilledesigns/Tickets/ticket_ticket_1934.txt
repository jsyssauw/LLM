Thank you for reaching out. To set up your HP DeskJet 3755 wirelessly, please ensure your printer, router, and devices are turned on and connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Download the HP Smart app on each device for the setup process. If the issue persists, try restarting your router and devices. If you need further help, please contact us again.
