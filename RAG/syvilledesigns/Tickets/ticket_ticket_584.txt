Subject: Surface Pro 7 Battery and Overheating Issues
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to report a sudden issue with my Microsoft Surface Pro 7, experienced in the past few days. The device, which is still under warranty, is encountering a rapid battery drain and overheating during basic usage like browsing and word processing.

Earlier, the battery lasted numerous hours on a full charge, but now struggles to maintain power for even a couple of hours. Additionally, the device becomes surprisingly hot to touch after short use. This change in performance triggers my concern for the longevity of the product.

I kindly ask for your assistance to address this issue as soon as possible. What are the steps to initiate a service request, and am I eligible for a replacement or repair under warranty?

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
<name>
