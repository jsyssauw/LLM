Subject: Assistance needed for MacBook Air M1 keyboard
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am experiencing a problem with my MacBook Air M1, where some of the keys on the keyboard are unresponsive. This issue started recently and has been quite inconvenient as it limits my ability to perform routine tasks.

I attempted some basic troubleshooting steps such as rebooting the laptop and updating the operating system, but the problem persists. I rely heavily on my MacBook for work and personal activities, so resolving this issue is quite urgent for me.

Could you please guide me on the next steps? Is there a way to repair the keyboard, or would I need to consider a replacement? Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
