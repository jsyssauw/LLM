I am reaching out to request urgent assistance regarding a problem I am encountering with Jira Software, version 8.20. After logging into the platform, I receive an Error 403 notification and cannot proceed any further. This issue has significantly affected my ability to efficiently manage my projects, and I am looking for your quick resolution regarding this matter.
