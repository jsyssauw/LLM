Subject: Issue with HP DeskJet 3755 Printing
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support, I am writing to bring to your attention a recurring issue with my HP DeskJet 3755 printer purchased from your store. The color printing function intermittently fails, which significantly hinders my daily tasks that require reliable color printing. At times, the printer will function as expected, but frequently it defaults to printing in black and white, or fails to print at all when a color document is intended. Such inconsistencies are frustrating and detrimental to my workflow. I have attempted basic troubleshooting including cartridge checks and software updates to no avail. I would appreciate if your tech team could inspect this device to diagnose and resolve the issue. Please advise on the procedure to proceed with this inspection. My customer ID is <cust_id> and the purchase was made on <purchase_date>. Looking forward to your prompt response and a viable solution. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Regards, <name>
