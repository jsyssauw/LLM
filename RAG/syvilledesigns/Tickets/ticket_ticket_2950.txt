I am writing to express my frustration with the Epson EcoTank ET-4760 printer I purchased from your store. It frequently jams and fails to complete print jobs, causing significant disruptions. The persistent paper feed issues prevent me from achieving consistent results. I have attempted various troubleshooting methods, but the problem persists. I kindly request assistance in resolving these issues at your earliest convenience. Please advise on potential solutions or the possibility of a replacement. Thank you for your prompt attention.
