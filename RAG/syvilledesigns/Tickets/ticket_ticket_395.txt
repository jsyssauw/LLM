Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I am writing to report an issue with my new MacBook Air M1. It seems that the device is experiencing problems with its battery. The laptop only operates when it is plugged into a power source and refuses to charge. Given these symptoms, I suspect there might be a fault with the battery. 

I purchased this MacBook Air M1 from your store and it is still under warranty. 

Item Details:
- Product Name: MacBook Air M1
- Serial Number: <serial_num>

Could you please guide me through the process for warranty service or direct me to a nearby service center? I would appreciate a quick response as I use my laptop for daily work and study routines.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
