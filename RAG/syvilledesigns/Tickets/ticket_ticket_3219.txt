Subject: High Priority Incident: Router Connectivity Issues
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report a high-priority incident involving unstable connectivity issues with our Cisco Router ISR4331, which is currently impacting the performance of our enterprise network. Our entire network operations depend heavily on this router, and any disruptions can lead to significant operational setbacks.

The connectivity issues started occurring approximately 48 hours ago and have progressively worsened. Our IT team has conducted preliminary troubleshooting, which includes checking the physical connections, updating the firmware, and resetting the device multiple times; however, these actions have not resolved the issue. The router still exhibits sporadic connectivity drop-offs, causing disruptions in our daily workflows and negatively affecting the user experience within our enterprise.

We are requesting immediate technical assistance from your team to diagnose and resolve this matter as quickly as possible. Given that this issue is causing serious disruptions in our business operations, we would appreciate a swift response and an onsite assessment if required.

Please let us know the next steps to take and if any additional information is needed from our end for a quicker resolution. You can reach me at <tel_num> or email me directly for any further queries. Our goal is to get this critical issue resolved at the earliest to mitigate any potential downsides resulting from prolonged network downtimes.

Thank you for attending to this matter with urgency. I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
