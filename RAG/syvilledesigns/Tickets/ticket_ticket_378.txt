Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Hello Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express our concerns regarding a recurring connectivity issue we have been facing, which seems to be affecting our network's overall performance. Our system relies on the Cisco Router ISR4331 for maintaining seamless operations, but recently, users have reported occasional disruptions that interfere with their workflow.

As per our preliminary analysis, we suspect that these issues might be linked to the router's need for a firmware update, as it has not been updated in the past few cycles. Our IT team conducted basic troubleshooting; however, the interruptions persist despite these efforts. 

We are eager to resolve this matter promptly to ensure continued reliability in our systems. Could you please advise on the necessary steps required to update the router's firmware, or if there are alternative solutions we should consider?

Your assistance in this matter is much appreciated. If you need further details about our setup or any specific logs, please let us know.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
