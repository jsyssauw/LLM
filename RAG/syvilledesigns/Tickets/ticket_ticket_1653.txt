Subject: Billing Assistance Required
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to request assistance with a billing adjustment related to our recent usage of the AWS Management Service, provided through your esteemed IT Services company. I represent <Company> and we have an account under the number <acc_num> that is associated with our ongoing AWS infrastructure operations.

Upon reviewing our usage and subsequent billing statement for the last quarter, we noticed certain discrepancies which we would like to clarify. For the duration of the last quarter, our AWS Management Service was utilized to enhance various aspects of our operational infrastructure, yet the billing seems higher than initially anticipated.

What I'd appreciate is a comprehensive review of the charges linked to our account. Specifically, the billing reflects charges that were not discussed or predicted in our previous correspondence regarding expected usage rates and associated expenses. My team conducted an internal audit and found differences in the projections versus the billed amounts in the billing documentation provided by you on <date>.

It would be extremely beneficial if we could arrange a detailed breakdown of the billed items, accompanied by detailed usage metrics, and a written explanation for each charge where discrepancies have been noted. Additionally, I would like to inquire if there are any ongoing discounts or billing mechanisms that would better suit our usage patterns but were not applied to our account. Your guidance on any available options for invoicing adjustments under the current service agreement would be much appreciated.

For quick resolution of this matter, I am available for further discussions at your earliest convenience. Please feel free to reach out to me directly via email or at my phone number, <tel_num>, anytime during business hours. Alternatively, my colleague <name> can be contacted in my absence for any clarifications needed.

Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter. I anticipate your insights and hope to resolve this discrepancy in a timely fashion. Looking forward to your prompt response.

Kind regards,
