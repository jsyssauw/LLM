Subject: MacBook Air Issue
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I have encountered with the MacBook Air M1 I recently purchased from your store. My name is <name>, and my order was placed under the account number <acc_num> last month. Upon receiving the laptop, I noticed that its battery is non-functional, rendering the device completely unusable. For such a significant investment and a product known for its reliability, this has been quite disappointing.

I have attempted several troubleshooting steps, including resetting the SMC and ensuring the charging adapter is functioning properly, but unfortunately, the problem persists. Understanding that defects can occasionally happen, I am requesting a replacement device or a full refund. I believe this is a fair resolution given the circumstances.

For further correspondence, feel free to reach me at <email> or via phone at <tel_num>. I hope for a quick resolution to this matter, as the laptop is urgent for my work.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this issue. Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

<name>
