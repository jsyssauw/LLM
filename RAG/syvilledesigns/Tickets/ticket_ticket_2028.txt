Subject: Wireless Printing Issue
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report an issue with my HP DeskJet 3755 printer. After a recent firmware update, the wireless printing functionality has unexpectedly stopped working. This interruption has significantly disrupted my daily routine and printing tasks. 

Despite following all recommended troubleshooting steps such as restarting the printer, reconnecting to the Wi-Fi network, and ensuring that the latest firmware version installed correctly, the issue persists. The printer successfully prints through USB, but the wireless feature remains non-functional, which is inconvenient. 

As a loyal customer of Tech Online Store, I trust your team can provide a swift resolution to this problem. Please advise if there are any additional steps I should attempt, or if a replacement or service maintenance is required. I am reachable at <tel_num> for further discussion. I would appreciate any assistance you can provide in resolving this issue at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Best regards,
