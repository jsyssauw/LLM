Customer Issue: Hello Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to request assistance regarding a billing issue I encountered with my recent purchase of the annual license for Visual Studio Code 1.70. It appears that I have been billed twice for this product, and I would appreciate it if you could look into this matter.

To aid in your investigation, the purchase was made under the account linked to <acc_num>, and the transaction IDs associated with the charges are <transaction_id_1> and <transaction_id_2>. I kindly request a review of these charges and a refund for the duplicate payment.

Your prompt attention to this issue would be greatly appreciated. Please feel free to contact me at <tel_num> for any further details needed.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
