I am writing to report an ongoing issue with our AWS infrastructure managed through your AWS Management Service. We are experiencing deployment failures, severely impacting our cloud-based services. This disruption is affecting our business operations and clients. We suspect there might be inefficiencies in these deployments, which is why a detailed cost optimization review is essential. This problem has been persistent for the past few days and requires urgent resolution. We would appreciate your immediate attention to diagnose and resolve this issue.
