Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring attention to a discrepancy I noticed in my recent billing for the Microsoft Office 365 subscription associated with my account number <acc_num>. The amount charged does not match the agreed subscription fee, and I am unable to locate a detailed invoice statement to understand the additional charges applied.

Could you please provide me with a comprehensive invoice statement that outlines all charges related to this billing period? If possible, I would also appreciate any breakdowns or explanations for the additional charges that have been applied. 

I believe having this information will help clarify any misunderstandings and ensure accuracy in future billing. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
