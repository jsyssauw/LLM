Subject: Request for billing method change discussion
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a review and possible alteration of the billing method currently being used for our invoices related to the IT Consulting Service. With increasing demand for better cost management and financial transparency, we believe that transitioning to a more detailed billing structure might be beneficial.

We feel that the current billing method lacks the granularity needed for effective financial oversight, and a change would assist us in tracking expenses more accurately and optimizing our budgeting strategies. This request aims to enhance our collaborative relationship with your firm and ensure that our partnership remains productive.

Please let me know the process for initiating this change and any documents needed for the transition. I look forward to your prompt response.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
