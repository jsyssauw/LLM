Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. With the update to Chrome 102.0, it's possible that some extensions may need to be updated as well. Please try the following steps:

1. Open Chrome and go to 'chrome://extensions/' to check for any updates available for your extensions. Update if prompted.
2. Disable and then re-enable the extensions to refresh their settings.
3. Clear your browser cache to prevent any conflicting cached data.
4. Restart your browser after completing these steps.

If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the extension developer for compatibility updates. Let us know if you need further assistance.

Best regards,
Customer Support
