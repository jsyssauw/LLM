I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you of an ongoing issue with the HP DeskJet 3755 printer that I purchased from your store. We have been facing regular paper jams during normal operations, which has been quite disruptive. Even though we follow all the usage instructions and conduct routine cleaning, the problem persists.

I would appreciate any advice on how to resolve this issue or information on any warranty service options that may be available. A timely response would be immensely appreciated, as we rely on this printer for essential tasks. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
