Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to bring to your attention an ongoing issue with our Cisco Router ISR4331, which has been resulting in frequent network dropouts. This has been a continual issue over the last few weeks and is severely impacting our daily operations. Our organization hinges on a consistent and secure network connection, and the current interruptions are detrimentally affecting our efficiency and service quality.

The router in question, model ISR4331, is a crucial element of our network setup and therefore necessitates immediate intervention. We have tried to resolve the matter internally, but have been unsuccessful in pinpointing the cause of the performance issue. Potential causes we believe may be at play include hardware failure or a software configuration fault. That said, we remain open to other possible issues that could benefit from your expert analysis.

We have maintained a reliable service contract with your firm, and we trust you will continue to offer us dependable support. In light of the severity and urgency of this situation, we respectfully request a swift review and prompt resolution. Included are the network logs as well as a brief overview of the troubleshooting measures we have undertaken thus far. We are keen to collaborate closely at this stage and stand ready to provide any further information you might need.

Anticipating your rapid response. For any urgent inquiries, please contact me directly at <tel_num>.
