Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to request assistance with an issue I've encountered with the debugging extended code analysis feature in the Python IDE, PyCharm 2024.2. My name is <name> and my account number is <acc_num>. I am currently working on a critical project that heavily relies on this feature, and it seems to not be functioning as expected. Every time I attempt to debug, the application freezes, causing significant delays. I have tried reinstalling the software, but the problem persists. Additionally, I have checked for any patches or updates, but everything seems up to date. Could you provide any guidance or potential solutions that might help resolve this issue? It's important for my workflow to get this sorted promptly. I am hoping for your expertise and a prompt resolution to this concern. You can reach me at <tel_num> during normal business hours. Thank you for your time and support in this matter. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the issue with the debugging extended code analysis feature in PyCharm 2024.2. We understand the importance of a quick resolution for your critical project.

Firstly, ensure that your system meets all minimum requirements for PyCharm 2024.2. If these are in place, try the following steps:

1. Reset Settings: Restore the default settings in PyCharm by navigating to "File > Manage IDE settings > Restore Default Settings."

2. Invalidate Caches: Go to "File > Invalidate Caches / Restart...". This might resolve potential conflicts or corrupted data causing the application to freeze.

3. Check Plugins: Sometimes, third-party plugins can cause performance issues. Disable all non-essential plugins and try debugging again.

4. Allocate More Memory: Increase the heap size for memory: "Help > Edit Custom VM Options," and ensure the Xmx setting is appropriate for your workload.

5. Look at Logs: Consult the “Help > Show Log in Explorer” for error messages that may pinpoint specific components causing the issue.

If these steps do not resolve your issue, please send us the log files or any error messages directly at support@<company>.com, so we can delve deeper. We'll aim for the fastest solution possible.
