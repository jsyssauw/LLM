I am sorry to hear about the paper jam issues you are experiencing with your HP DeskJet 3755. To resolve this matter, please ensure that the paper is loaded correctly and check that the rollers are clean. It might also be helpful to update the printerâ€™s firmware. If these solutions do not work, I suggest resetting the printer settings. If issues persist, we may need to consider the option of a replacement.
