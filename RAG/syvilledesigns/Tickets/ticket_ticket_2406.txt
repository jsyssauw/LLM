Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,<br><br>I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I am experiencing with my Microsoft Surface Pro 7. Recently, I have noticed that the touchscreen has been having intermittent issues with responsiveness, which is affecting my productivity and overall usage of the device. I rely heavily on my Surface Pro for my daily activities, both personal and professional, and this issue has become quite disruptive.<br><br>The touchscreen fails to respond to touch inputs sporadically which requires me to restart the device frequently to regain functionality.

I have attempted basic troubleshooting steps such as recalibrating the screen and updating drivers, but the issue persists.<br><br>I would appreciate it if you could provide guidance on how to address this issue or suggest possible solutions. Additionally, I would like to know if this problem is covered under warranty.<br><br>Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your prompt reply.<br><br>Regards,<br><name>
Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us about your Microsoft Surface Pro 7 touchscreen issue. We understand how disruptive this can be to your daily activities, and we're here to help.

Firstly, we recommend performing a complete restart of your device and ensuring all latest Windows updates are installed. Since you've already tried recalibration and driver updates, the next step would be to perform a system reset, choosing to keep your files intact, to rule out any software-related causes.

Regarding warranty coverage, please check your purchase receipt or your Microsoft account for warranty information. Most hardware issues reported within the warranty period are typically covered. If your Surface Pro 7 is under warranty, we suggest arranging a repair through your Microsoft account directly or visiting a nearby authorized service center.

If none of the above solutions work, please reach out to us again, and we can assist further or help in arranging the necessary service for your device.

Thank you for your patience and cooperation. We aim to resolve your issue promptly.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
