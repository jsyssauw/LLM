Customer Service answer: Dear <name>, 

Thank you for reaching out. We understand the urgency of optimizing your AWS infrastructure for cost efficiency and improvement in deployment. To proceed, we recommend starting by analyzing your current resource usage through AWS Cost Explorer. Following this, consider implementing AWS Trusted Advisor to identify potential cost savings, and leveraging Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for long-term workloads. If you need detailed guidance or assistance with these tools, please let us know, and we can arrange a consultation with our specialists.
