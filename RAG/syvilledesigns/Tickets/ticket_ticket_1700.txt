Subject: Inquiry About Billing Discrepancy
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Support Team,

I trust you are well. I am contacting you to bring attention to a minor inconsistency I observed in my recent billing statement for the AWS Management Service. My account number is <acc_num>, and the corresponding transaction is from October 10, 2023.

There appears to be an unexpected charge on the bill that, judging by my preliminary review, does not align with my usage projections or subscription details. I believe this could be a minor oversight; however, I would genuinely appreciate a detailed breakdown of the charges to gain clarity.

Could you please send me an itemized bill specifying the nature of the charges, the timeframes they cover, and any pertinent taxes or fees?

I trust in your quick handling of this matter and await your comprehensive response. Should you require any additional information, feel free to contact me at <tel_num> or reply to this email.

Thank you for your assistance.

Warm regards,

<name>
