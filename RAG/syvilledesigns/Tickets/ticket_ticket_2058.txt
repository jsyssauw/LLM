Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear IT Services Customer Support Team,

I am writing to bring to your attention a significant issue that our team has encountered with the integration of the ticket system which is severely affecting our workflow management. Starting from October, we've noticed consistent server errors that disrupt our operations related to the IT Consulting Service. These errors have led to delays and increased workload on our team, as we are unable to efficiently manage customer requests and internal processing. It seems to be an ongoing issue that's unresolved despite our initial troubleshooting.

We would appreciate it if you could urgently investigate this matter, as it's impacting our day-to-day operations and client satisfaction. Kindly escalate this to your technical experts at the earliest so we can avoid further disruptions. Please keep us posted with any updates or if further information from our side is needed.

Thank you in advance for your prompt assistance.

Best Regards,
