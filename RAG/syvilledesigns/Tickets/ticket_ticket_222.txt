Hello <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us. 

Currently, the MacBook Air M1 is available at our Tech Online Store. We recommend contacting your local store directly for the most accurate pricing and potential in-store offers or discounts, as these may vary.

For delivery, shipping charges are calculated at checkout, and delivery times depend on your location. You can also opt for in-store pickup, usually available within 1-2 business days after your purchase is confirmed, but this can vary by store.

Please feel free to get in touch if you need more information.

Best regards,
Tech Online Store Customer Support
