Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support, I am writing to report an urgent issue I am experiencing with Visual Studio Code (version 1.70). After the recent update, I have encountered a serious problem while trying to debug extensions. The application consistently freezes and crashes during the debugging process, significantly hindering my workflow. Prior to the update, I never faced such interruptions, which makes me suspect it might be linked to the recent changes. I have attempted standard troubleshooting methods, including reinstalling the extensions and clearing any cached data, but the issue persists. This problem is affecting my productivity, especially since I depend on this IDE for my daily development tasks. I kindly request urgent assistance in resolving this issue, as it is critical to resume my tasks without further disruptions. If needed, I can provide any necessary logs or additional information to aid in the diagnosis of this issue. Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your swift response. Best regards, <name>
Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out and bringing this issue to our attention. We understand the urgency and inconvenience you're facing with Visual Studio Code after the update.

To address the freezing and crashing issue during debugging, here are a few additional steps you can attempt:

1. **Update Visual Studio Code**: Ensure you have the latest version as new updates may resolve known bugs.
2. **Disable Extensions**: Temporarily disable extensions in Visual Studio Code to identify if a specific one is causing the problem.
3. **Check for Known Issues**: Visit the Visual Studio Code GitHub repository or community forums to see if other users are encountering similar issues post-update.
4. **Revert to Previous Version**: Consider rolling back to an earlier version of Visual Studio Code, before the update, if possible, to restore stability.

As you offered, providing logs and additional information would be beneficial if the issue persists. Please share these with us, and we will escalate it to our technical team for a more detailed analysis.

We are committed to resolving this issue swiftly so you can continue your development work uninterrupted. Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
