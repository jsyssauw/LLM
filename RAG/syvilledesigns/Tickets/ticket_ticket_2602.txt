Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report an issue with my recently purchased Dell XPS 13 model 9310. The device has been experiencing frequent overheating issues, which I suspect might be due to a malfunctioning internal fan. The overheating started a few weeks after purchase, and it's becoming increasingly problematic as it affects the device's performance.

Bought the laptop from your website with order number <order_num>. It has become crucial to address this issue to ensure the longevity and usability of the device.

Could you kindly advise on the best course of action? I look forward to your prompt response and any troubleshooting steps or warranty support you can offer.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
