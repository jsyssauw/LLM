Subject: Jira Workflow Change Request
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I am writing to request a workflow change in our current Jira system to enhance task tracking within our project management framework. We are using Jira Software 8.20, and have noticed that the existing workflow does not fully meet our team's needs for efficient task management. 

We suggest implementing more granular status updates and additional fields to better categorize tasks and priorities. This improvement is crucial for maintaining optimal productivity and ensuring timely project deliveries. We understand such changes need careful consideration, and thus, we are open to any interim solutions you might propose.

Please let us know the next steps in proceeding with the customization. You can contact me any time at <tel_num>. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

<name>
