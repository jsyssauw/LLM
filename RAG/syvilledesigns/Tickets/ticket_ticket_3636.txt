Hello <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. We're sorry to hear you're experiencing issues with Jira Software version 8.20. To assist you effectively, please check for any pending updates or patches for Jira, as these might resolve the problem. It would be helpful to know the specific error messages you receive when updating ticket status. For the logout issue, ensure your session timeout settings are configured appropriately. Clearing your browser cache or trying a different browser might improve performance.
