Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I am writing to report an issue with an invoice generated for our recent use of your IT Consulting Services. It appears there is a discrepancy in the number of hours charged for the server administration consulting. Our records indicate a usage of approximately 30 hours, but the invoice lists 50 hours. Could you please review and correct this? I am attaching the relevant documentation for your reference.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
