Subject: Persistent Connectivity Problems with Network
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Support Team,

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue concerning our Cisco Router ISR4331. We have been experiencing frequent disconnections, which are significantly disrupting our network stability. This problem has continued for several weeks and seems to be deteriorating. Our daily operations largely depend on our networking setup, and these disruptions are causing notable delays.

Despite our internal troubleshooting efforts, we have not been successful in identifying a definitive cause or any workaround to alleviate these interruptions. We have verified that the router's firmware and software are current and that all settings comply with the suggested guidelines.

We have noted that these troubles typically manifest during high network demand, yet they also occur sporadically throughout the day. Unfortunately, replacing the equipment is not a feasible solution at present due to budget constraints and logistical issues.

We would greatly appreciate your assistance in addressing this situation at your earliest convenience. If necessary, we are open to arranging a call or remote session with your technical team to perform further diagnostics. Please let us know the best next steps to take.

Thank you for your comprehension and support.

Best regards,

To address the intermittent connection drops, we suggest trying the following initial measures if you haven't already:

1. Check if there are any reported issues from your ISP during peak usage hours.
2. Review the router logs for any irregularities or errors that might point to the root cause.
3. Verify that your bandwidth settings meet your current usage needs.
4. If you havenâ€™t done so yet, restart the router fully to rule out any temporary issues.

Considering the ongoing nature of this problem, it would be beneficial to schedule a call or a remote diagnostic appointment with our technical specialists. Please provide us with some suitable times and dates that work for you, so we can organize this as soon as possible.
