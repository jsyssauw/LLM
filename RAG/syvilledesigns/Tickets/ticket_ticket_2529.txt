Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I trust this message finds you well. I am reaching out to report an issue I have been facing with my MacBook Air M1, which I acquired from Tech Online Store. While watching videos, the screen intermittently flickers, which is quite irritating and disrupts my overall viewing experience. The flickering happens unpredictably and occurs regardless of the video player or the resolution settings being used. This issue started a few weeks ago and has persisted since then.

Could you please offer advice on troubleshooting methods or possible repair options regarding this issue? I anticipate your prompt response.

Best regards,

Customer Service answer: Hi <name>,

We appreciate your message. Screen flickering on the MacBook Air M1 can result from several causes. Initially, try restarting your device and verifying that your macOS is up to date with the latest version. If the issue continues, please attempt resetting the NVRAM and the SMC. Moreover, try adjusting the "Displays" settings in System Preferences. Should these suggestions not resolve the issue, a professional assessment may be necessary. We advise visiting an Apple Store or an authorized service center for further assistance. Let us know if you need any additional help.

Best regards,
Customer Support
