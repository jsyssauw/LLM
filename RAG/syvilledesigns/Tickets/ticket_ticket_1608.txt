Subject: Need Help: Problem with Display Flickering
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Hello Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I am reaching out to notify you about an issue I am facing with my Dell XPS 13 laptop, model 9310, which I bought from your store a few months ago. Lately, I have observed that the display flickers unpredictably, especially when I frequently adjust the brightness levels during operation. This has caused considerable disruption in my work and has also placed strain on my eyes.

I have tried several basic troubleshooting methods, like updating the device drivers and ensuring that the operating system is up to date; however, these efforts did not solve the problem. I also verified the physical connections, and everything seems intact.

Considering the ongoing nature of this issue, I am requesting guidance on the appropriate next steps. Should I bring my laptop to one of your service locations for assessment, or is there a chance of receiving assistance remotely? Moreover, I would appreciate clarification on whether this problem is covered by the warranty associated with my purchase.

Could you inform me about the documentation I need to provide and any additional instructions? I would like to resolve this matter as soon as possible to continue using the laptop efficiently for my work.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
