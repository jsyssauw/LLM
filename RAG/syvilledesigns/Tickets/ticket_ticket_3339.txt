Subject: Billing Issues with Adobe Photoshop
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is <name>, and I am encountering issues with the renewal of my Adobe Photoshop 2024 subscription, particularly with the billing and payment method. My account number is <acc_num>. Upon attempting to renew the subscription, I received an error message stating that my current payment method, which is a <card_type>, ending in <last4digits>, is no longer valid or accepted.

I would appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter. I am unsure whether the issue is with the card details on file or a technical problem within your billing system. Moreover, I am keen to update my payment method to ensure uninterrupted service. Please advise on the best course of action and whether additional information is required from my end.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Looking forward to your assistance.

Sincerely,

<name>
