Subject: Issue with Microsoft Surface Pro 7
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an issue I have been experiencing with a product I recently purchased from your store, the Microsoft Surface Pro 7. It's been an impressive piece of technology in many aspects, but I am encountering a recurring problem that is becoming increasingly bothersome.

I started noticing sporadic screen flickering on the device during light usage scenarios, such as browsing the web or working on office applications. This flickering does not occur constantly but rather at irregular intervals. It began a few days after initial setup and has been persistent since then.

Initially, I thought it might be tied to specific software, so I made sure to update all drivers and applications, including the latest Windows updates. Despite these efforts, the issue persists. From my observation, the flickering seems random and not linked to any particular program or task. Sometimes it flickers during video playback, and other times while nothing seems to be running heavily in the background.

This situation is quite concerning as it affects the usability of the device, especially when trying to work for extended periods. The flickering seems to become a distraction, and I am concerned it might indicate a deeper underlying hardware issue which could potentially worsen over time.

Could you please advise on what steps I should take next? Is there a possibility of a repair or replacement under warranty, or are there any troubleshooting steps that I might have overlooked? Any guidance you can provide would be very much appreciated as I rely on this device for both work and entertainment purposes.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and hope for a satisfactory resolution soon.

Best regards,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to Tech Online Store Customer Support regarding the issue with your Microsoft Surface Pro 7. I'm sorry to hear about the screen flickering you're experiencing.

Based on your description, it sounds like a hardware-related concern, especially since you've already updated your drivers and Windows. I recommend following these steps:

1. Ensure that your deviceâ€™s firmware is up-to-date. If you haven't already, check for the latest firmware updates from Microsoft.
2. Perform a hard reset by holding down the power button for 30 seconds, then releasing it and pressing it again for quick troubleshooting.
3. Test your device in Safe Mode to see if the flickering persists, which can help determine if background applications might be causing the issue.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, please contact our support team directly at <contact_number> or visit our service center for further assistance. Your Surface Pro should be eligible for repair or replacement under warranty if a hardware fault is confirmed.

We understand how important your device is to your daily activities, and we are committed to resolving this matter promptly.

Best regards,
Tech Online Store Customer Support
