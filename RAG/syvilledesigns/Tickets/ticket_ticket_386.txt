Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about the trouble with your MacBook Air M1. Please ensure it's fully charged, perform a force restart by holding the power button for 10 seconds, and reset the SMC and NVRAM if possible. If the issue persists, I recommend initiating a return or exchange under warranty. You can do this online using your order number <order_num> or visiting one of our stores. Let us know if further assistance is needed.

Best regards,
Customer Support Team
