Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue we are experiencing with our Jira Software 8.20. Despite having correct configuration settings, the system is not sending automated notifications for ticket updates. This issue is affecting our team's efficiency as we're missing important updates. Adjusting settings or permissions has not resolved the issue. We would appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter promptly. Please contact me at <tel_num> or via email at <email> for further information.

Thank you,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the issue with Jira notifications. We understand the impact this is having on your team's efficiency and are here to help.

Firstly, please ensure that the notification scheme is correctly associated with the respective projects. Sometimes, issues might arise if the notification scheme is not properly set up. Verify that the email addresses in the system are correct and that there are no filters blocking the incoming emails.

If the issue persists, please try restarting the Jira application or check server logs for any errors that could indicate a misconfiguration. Additionally, it might be helpful to check if your server's resources, such as memory and storage, aren't being maximized, as this could cause delays or delivery failures.

If these suggestions do not resolve the issue, we recommend opening a support ticket with our technical team for a more in-depth investigation. You can reach us directly at your convenience.

Best regards,
