Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the issues with your Cisco Router ISR4331. We understand the critical nature of network stability for your organization and are here to help.

To begin troubleshooting, please ensure the router firmware is up-to-date and check for any visible damages or loose connections in the setup. Additionally, we recommend restarting the router if it hasn't been rebooted in a while to see if that temporarily resolves the issue.

Please provide us with logs from the System and Interface to assist with deeper analysis. Our technical team will then conduct a detailed investigation to identify the root cause and provide you with a solution.

Meanwhile, if further immediate assistance is required, feel free to contact our support hotline at any time.

Best regards,  
Customer Support Team
