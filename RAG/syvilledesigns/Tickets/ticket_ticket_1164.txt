Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the issues with Google Chrome extensions on version 102.0. To address the crashes you're experiencing, please follow these steps:

1. **Update Chrome**: Ensure that your Chrome browser is up to date. Sometimes, newer updates resolve compatibility issues.
2. **Disable Problematic Extensions**: Identify the extensions causing crashes by disabling them one by one and checking for stability.
3. **Clear Browsing Data**: Go to Chrome settings, clear cache and cookies to see if performance improves.
4. **Check for Extensions Updates**: Make sure all your extensions are updated to their latest versions.
5. **Reinstall Extensions**: Remove and reinstall the problematic extensions from the Chrome Web Store.
6. **Safe Mode**: Launch Chrome in Safe Mode to check if extensions are causing conflicts. If it runs smoothly, it's likely an extension is the issue.
7. **Consult Incompatibility List**: Check Chrome's official site for a list of known incompatible extensions with your version.

For any available patches or updates targeting this issue, visit Chrome's official support page or their community forums regularly.
