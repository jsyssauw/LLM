I'm experiencing fluctuations in my AWS billing statement and need clarity on this matter. It seems to be affected by changing service usage and auto-scaling updates related to the AWS Management Service. Can you help me understand these changes?

Customer Service answer: Hello <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. Fluctuations in your AWS billing statement are often due to dynamic usage changes, particularly with auto-scaling and service updates. Auto-scaling can adjust resource use automatically based on demand, consequently impacting your costs. I recommend reviewing the billing dashboard in your AWS Management Console for detailed insights. Please contact us if you need further assistance or specific queries.

Best regards,
Service Desk Agent
