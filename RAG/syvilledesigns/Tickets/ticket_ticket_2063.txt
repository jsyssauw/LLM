Subject: Wi-Fi connectivity issues affecting productivity on Dell XPS 13 9310
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support, 

I am experiencing intermittent Wi-Fi connectivity issues with my Dell XPS 13 9310, which has begun to significantly affect my online work productivity. Despite being connected, the Wi-Fi frequently drops and reconnects, leading to disruptions during video conferences and file uploads. I have confirmed the issue is not network-wide, as other devices do not face similar problems. Could you please advise on available remedies or if this requires warranty service? Your prompt assistance would be appreciated.

Thank you,
