Subject: Slow Startup Problem
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope you are doing well. I am contacting you to voice a concern about my recent acquisition of a Dell XPS 13 9310 from your Tech Online Store. Since I began using it last month, I have been encountering ongoing difficulties during boot up. It takes an excessively long time to completely start up, which is significantly hindering my daily work schedule.

As this laptop is crucial for my job, its performance issues are adversely affecting my efficiency. The slow boot time means I waste substantial periods waiting for it to become operational, which is particularly unsettling at the beginning of hectic workdays.

I have attempted various methods to rectify this issue myself, including deactivating startup programs and verifying that all drivers are current, but regrettably, the problem remains.

I politely request your assistance in diagnosing this issue or perhaps looking into other options for achieving a quicker boot time. Please inform me of the next steps I should take or if there is a support specialist with whom I could discuss this matter directly.

Thank you for your attention to this issue, and I eagerly await your swift response so we can hopefully resolve this matter expediently.

Best regards,
<name>
