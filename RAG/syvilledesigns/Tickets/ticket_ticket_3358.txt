Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for contacting us. To address the Jira backlog display issue in version 8.20, please ensure that your board configuration settings are correct, and check if all necessary permissions are granted for viewing the backlog. Additionally, verify that there are no filters inadvertently hiding items from the backlog. If the problem continues, consider updating Jira to the latest version and examine any recent plugin conflicts. For personalized assistance, you may contact our technical support team directly using your <acc_num>. 

Please let us know if further support is needed.

Best regards,
