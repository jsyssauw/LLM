Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with your MacBook Air M1. Please follow these steps to possibly resolve it:

1. Ensure the charger and outlet are working by testing with another compatible device.
2. Perform an SMC reset. To do this on your MacBook Air M1, connect the charger, press and hold the power button for 10 seconds, then release and try to power it on again.
3. Check for any visible damage to the charging cable and port.

If the problem persists, I recommend contacting Apple Support directly or visiting an Apple Authorized Service Provider for further diagnostics. Since your device is less than a year old, it may still be under warranty which could cover service costs.

If you need more assistance, feel free to reach out with <tel_num> so we can arrange further support.

Regards,
<Customer Support Team>
