I am writing to report an issue we're experiencing with Microsoft Office 365 Excel. Our user, <name>, is unable to open Excel spreadsheets. They receive the error message 'File cannot be opened' repeatedly when attempting to access these files. Our IT team attempted several basic troubleshooting steps, including restarting the computer and reinstalling Excel, but the problem persists. Could you please advise on any known issues or provide further assistance? This issue is impacting our workflow, and prompt resolution would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. The error 'File cannot be opened' in Excel can sometimes be resolved by checking for updates via File > Account > Update Options > Update Now within Excel. Additionally, ensure the files are not located in a path that exceeds character limits.  If these steps do not resolve the issue, please check the files for corruption or check the file extension/compatibility. If the problem persists, I recommend contacting Microsoft Support directly.  Let us know if further assistance is needed.

Best regards,
Service Desk Agent
