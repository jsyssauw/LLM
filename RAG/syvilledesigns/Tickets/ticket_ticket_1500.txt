Customer Issue: Hello Customer Support Team, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification on a billing issue related to my Microsoft Office 365 subscription. Recently, I noticed an unexpected charge on my account <acc_num> after the renewal of my subscription, and I would like to understand the terms associated with it. Could you please provide detailed information about the billing cycle or any recent changes in pricing that might have affected my account?

Understanding these details is crucial for me as I make decisions regarding my future use of the subscription services provided by your esteemed company. Please let me know if you require any further information from my side or if a phone call would be preferable. You can reach me at <tel_num>. Thank you for your assistance. Best Regards, <name>
