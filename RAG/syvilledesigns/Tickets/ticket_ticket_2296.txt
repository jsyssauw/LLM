I regret to learn about the charging issue you're experiencing with your Galaxy Tab S7. Please follow these instructions:  

1. Clear the charging port.  
2. Restart your device.  
3. Execute a soft reset (press and hold the power and volume down buttons).  

Should the trouble continue, having the device examined may be necessary.
