I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my concern regarding an issue with Google Chrome version 102.0.

This issue significantly impacts my workflow and, from what I have gathered, many other users are experiencing similar difficulties. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or solutions you could provide to resolve this matter as efficiently as possible. Thank you for your attention to this urgent issue.

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the issue with Google Chrome version 102.0. We understand this can be disruptive to your workflow. Here are a few steps you can try to mitigate this issue:

1. Check for updates to see if there's a newer version of Chrome available, as updates often contain fixes for bugs.
2. Clear your browser cache and cookies, which can help improve performance.
3. Disable any unnecessary extensions that might be causing a conflict.
4. Try running Chrome in Incognito mode to see if the problem persists, which can indicate if extensions are involved.
5. Consider creating a new user profile in Chrome to rule out any profile-specific issues.

If the problem continues, please let us know, and we'll investigate further. We are sorry for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

Best regards,
