Subject: Upgrade Zoom Request
Incident Type: Change
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is <name>, and I am reaching out regarding an upgrade request for the Zoom application that we currently have integrated within our IT infrastructure. We are using Zoom version 5.11.0, and to ensure enhanced security alongside the integration of new features, we are keen to upgrade to the latest version available.

Given the current climate and the increase in usage of such platforms, it has become paramount to maintain the utmost security standards. Our users depend heavily on Zoom for daily operations and meetings, and ensuring we use the most secure and efficient version is crucial for our continuity. The recent updates from Zoom have reportedly addressed various security issues and introduced enhancements that we believe will significantly benefit our operations.

Could you guide us through the upgrade process, and let us know the best way to proceed? If there are specific requirements or prerequisites needed for the upgrade, kindly detail these as well. Additionally, we would appreciate if the potential downtime, if any, during this upgrade can also be estimated, allowing us to schedule and prepare accordingly.

Please feel free to contact me directly at <email_address> or by phone at <tel_num> if you require any additional information or have any questions.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request. We look forward to a seamless upgrade process with your support.

Best regards,
