Subject: Urgent: Bugs Causing Task Errors in Jira Software
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Hi Support Team,

I'm experiencing a critical issue with Jira Software version 8.20. It seems there is a bug causing errors in our project management tasks, and some queries fail to load entirely. This has negatively impacted our workflow, and we require an urgent solution to minimize disruption. Our team relies heavily on your software to track and manage tasks, and we hope you can address this quickly.

Please provide an estimated timeline for a fix or a workaround that we can implement in the meantime.
