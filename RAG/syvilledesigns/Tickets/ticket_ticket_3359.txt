Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the Samsung QLED QN90A. This model is known for its exceptional picture quality, powered by the Neo Quantum Processor 4K, and it features Quantum Matrix Technology for enhanced contrast and detail. Compared to other models, it offers superior HDR performance and anti-glare technology.

For initial setup, we recommend using the Smart Calibration feature for optimized picture settings and connecting to a sound system via the eARC port for enhanced audio. Placing the TV in a well-positioned area to take advantage of its ultra-wide viewing angle is also advisable.

Should you have further inquiries or require assistance, please feel free to respond to this message.
