Subject: Subscription Fee Clarification
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out today to gain some clarity regarding the recent billing statements connected to my subscription for Adobe Photoshop 2024. Upon reviewing my account, I noticed some discrepancies which have left me a bit confused. It seems that the fees have changed unexpectedly and I have not received any prior notice or explanation for these alterations. 

My subscription account number is <acc_num>, and I usually handle the payments via my card ending with <card_num>. Given the shift in billing amounts, I would appreciate if you could provide a detailed explanation or direct me to where I might find documentation or communication regarding this change. It is crucial for me to manage my financial planning effectively, and understanding these charges is a vital part of it. 

Moreover, if there are any ongoing promotions or alternative subscription options that I might take advantage of, I would appreciate hearing about those too. 

Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your prompt clarification on this matter. Please feel free to contact me via email or at my phone number <tel_num>. 

Best regards, 

<name>
