Subject: Urgent: Overheating Issue with New Ultrabook
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support,

I am writing to raise a concern with my recently purchased Dell XPS 13 9310, which is experiencing significant overheating issues during video calls. Despite being brand new, this problem is affecting my efficiency and I am worried about the safety of the device. It is disappointing given the investment in this ultrabook. I am seeking your guidance on how to proceed with troubleshooting or exchanging this unit, as it falls under warranty. Please advise on the next steps to resolve this issue promptly. I look forward to your quick response.

Thank you,
<name>
Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your Dell XPS 13 9310 overheating issue. We understand your concern and apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Firstly, please make sure that the laptop is placed on a hard, flat surface to allow proper ventilation. Check for any software updates or drivers that may need installing, as they can improve device performance.

If the issue persists, we advise you to perform a system diagnostics test using the built-in Dell SupportAssist tool. This can help identify hardware issues.

Given that your purchase is still under warranty, you are eligible for service or an exchange. Please provide your purchase details including the order number and attach a copy of your proof of purchase if requested. Our service team will then guide you on the process for an exchange or any necessary repairs.

Feel free to reply to this email or contact our support line at <tel_num> for immediate assistance. We will ensure a swift resolution to your problem.

Best regards,
Tech Online Store Support Team
