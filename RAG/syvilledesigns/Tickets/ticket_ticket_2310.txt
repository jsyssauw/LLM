Customer Issue: Hello,

I hope you are well. I am writing to report a connectivity issue with my Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer. Since performing the latest update, I am unable to print wirelessly. This problem arose right after the update, and it has disrupted my daily printing activities. I have tried restarting both my router and the printer, but the issue persists.

Could you please assist me in troubleshooting this problem? Thank you for your prompt attention.

Best regards,
