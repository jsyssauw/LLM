Therefore, we are eager for a team from your end to be dispatched at the earliest convenience to address and rectify the situation, ensuring minimal further disruption.

I would appreciate if a specialized technician could contact me directly to discuss the necessary steps moving forward. You can reach me by email at <email> or alternatively on my direct line at <tel_num>. Additionally, please refer to our account under the number <acc_num> for any necessary specifics related to our service agreement.
