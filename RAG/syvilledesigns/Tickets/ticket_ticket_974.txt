Subject: Frequent Network Disconnections Issue
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a persistent issue we are experiencing with frequent network disconnections. After conducting a thorough investigation, we have determined that these disruptions are caused by a configuration issue in our Cisco Router ISR4331, which is critical to our network operations.

The issue manifests as intermittent network connectivity loss, impacting both our internal and external communications severely. These disconnections are becoming increasingly disruptive to our operations, leading to a decline in productivity and possibly affecting our service delivery.

We suspect that the current Cisco Router ISR4331 configuration might not be optimized for our specific network demands or there may be an underlying firmware or compatibility issue. As this is beyond our expertise, we kindly request your immediate assistance to diagnose and recommend a solution to this problem.

Please let us know at your earliest convenience how we can proceed to resolve this matter efficiently. Should you need to reach out for further information or remote diagnostics, you can contact me directly.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this important issue.

Best regards,
