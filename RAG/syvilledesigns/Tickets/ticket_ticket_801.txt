Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my concern regarding the recent purchase I made from your store, an affected product: Dell XPS 13 9310, which unfortunately has been experiencing a faulty battery performance issue. 

The laptop was purchased under the account number <acc_num> on <date>. From the first use, I noticed the battery would not hold a charge as expected. It discharges rapidly, causing significant inconvenience, especially during important tasks. Given the premium reputation of Dell's XPS series, I believe this may be an anomaly, and I am keen on resolving this issue. 

I request an exchange for the affected unit with a new one. My contact details for any further communication are: Name: <name>, Phone: <tel_num>, Order ID: <order_id>. I am hopeful for a swift resolution, and I am more than willing to return this faulty product at my earliest convenience to expedite the process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and to continuing my experience with Tech Online Store.

Best regards,
