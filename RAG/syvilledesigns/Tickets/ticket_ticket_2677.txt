Customer Issue: Dear Customer Service,

I hope this message finds you well. I am contacting you to report an issue I am facing with my MacBook Air M1, which was bought from Tech Online Store. While I am watching videos, the display occasionally flickers, creating considerable distractions and diminishing the quality of the viewing experience. This flickering is erratic and happens regardless of the video player I use or the resolution settings. This problem started a few weeks back and has yet to be resolved.

Could you kindly provide some guidance on the troubleshooting steps or repair options that are available for this issue? I eagerly await your prompt response.

Sincerely,

<name>
Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. The screen flickering problem on the MacBook Air M1 could stem from various factors. To start, please try restarting your device and confirm that your macOS operating system is up to date. If the issue persists, it may be beneficial to reset the NVRAM and SMC and also adjust the "Displays" options within System Preferences. If these measures do not fix the problem, a professional evaluation may be warranted. We suggest visiting an Apple Store or an authorized service provider for further assistance. Should you need more help, feel free to contact us.

Best regards,
Customer Support
