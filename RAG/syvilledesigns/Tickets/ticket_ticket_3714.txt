Subject: Request for Product Return - Canon PIXMA MG3620
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a return for a product purchased from your Tech Online Store, which is currently experiencing connectivity issues. The item in question is the Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer, which I bought on <purchase_date> using my account number <acc_num>.

Since setting up the printer, I've encountered repeated interruptions during wireless printing, which have hindered my ability to effectively complete printing tasks. Despite following all troubleshooting steps outlined in the manual and on your support website, the connectivity issues persist. I have attempted multiple solutions, including network resets and firmware updates, but the problem remains unresolved.

Given this, I would appreciate it if you could authorize a return for this product, as it is within the warranty period. Please let me know the procedure I need to follow, including any necessary documents or information you require from my side. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response to arrange for the return and refund of the printer. If you need to contact me, please reach out at my registered phone number, <tel_num>.

Best regards,

<name>
