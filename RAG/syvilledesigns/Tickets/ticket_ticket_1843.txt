Subject: Urgent Assistance Needed for MacBook Air M1 Shutdowns
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Hello Customer Support Team, 

I am reaching out to you for urgent technical assistance regarding an issue with my MacBook Air M1, which I recently purchased from your store. Over the past few days, the device has been experiencing sudden shutdowns without any warning while in operation. This issue occurs randomly and has been significantly disrupting my work and daily activities. 

I have ensured that my operating system is up-to-date and have also performed a thorough check without identifying any hardware discrepancies myself. Unfortunately, the unexpected shutdowns continue to occur, which has made the device unreliable for everyday use. 

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this problem? If a technical inspection or service appointment is required, kindly direct me to the appropriate setup procedure. Since this is crucial for my professional responsibilities, I appreciate any expedited assistance you can offer. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. Please let me know of any information you require from my end. 

Best regards,
