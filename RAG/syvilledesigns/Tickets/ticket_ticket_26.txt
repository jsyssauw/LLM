Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support, 

I hope this message finds you well. My name is <name> and I recently purchased a Dell XPS 13 9310 from your store. I am reaching out to gather information on optimizing the battery performance for my device, which is running on the Windows 10 system. As you can imagine, ensuring maximum efficiency and longevity of the battery is crucial for my use case. I've noticed that the battery life may not be performing up to the expected standards despite balancing the screen brightness and power settings.

Could you please provide detailed guidance or steps that I can take to improve the battery life? Additionally, information on any software optimizations, firmware updates, or settings adjustments that are recommended by both Dell and Microsoft would be greatly appreciated. If there are any specific tools or diagnostics available from your support team, please let me know how I can access these as well.
