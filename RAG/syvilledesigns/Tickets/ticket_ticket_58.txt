Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support Team, 

I am writing to seek assistance with a persistent issue I am facing with Adobe Photoshop 2024 purchased from your store, order number <order_num>. The software currently experiences significant delays during loading, impacting my workflow negatively. Upon launching the application, it stalls at the initialization screen for several minutes, which is quite concerning and not what I expect from a newly released software version.

I have ensured my system meets all the software requirements, and I have installed all available updates both for Adobe Photoshop and my operating system, yet the problem persists. I have also tried reinstalling the software, clearing cache files, and checking for conflicting applications, following the usual troubleshooting steps provided online. Unfortunately, these actions have not resolved the issue.

Could you provide any guidance or additional troubleshooting steps that may help me resolve this situation? Any insights or solutions your team could offer would be greatly appreciated. Additionally, I would appreciate a confirmation on the software's compatibility with recent updates which might be contributing to this problem.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards, 
<name>
Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the issue with Adobe Photoshop 2024. We're sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. Please try the following additional steps: 

1. Check if your graphics card driver is up to date or if an earlier version is more stable with the software.
2. Disable third-party plugins to see if they are causing conflicts, then re-enable them one by one.
3. Adjust the performance preferences in Photoshop, particularly the allocated RAM and GPU settings, to optimize resource usage.
4. Use the Adobe Creative Cloud Cleaner Tool to remove previous installations that might have left over conflicting files.

Regarding compatibility, we recommend checking Adobe’s website for any recent advisories on updates, as they might affect performance. 

If these steps don’t resolve the issue, please provide us with additional details about your system specifications, and we can assist you further. Let us know how it goes!
