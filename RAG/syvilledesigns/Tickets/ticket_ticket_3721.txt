Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for contacting Tech Online Store Customer Support. The MacBook Air M1 is known for its impressive performance with graphic design software, including Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. The M1 chip, with its M1 Neural Engine and powerful GPU, handles graphic tasks smoothly, making it a viable option for digital design work.

However, be aware that while the majority of Adobe programs are optimized for the M1, some plugins may not yet be fully compatible. Adobe continues to update their software to enhance compatibility and performance. As a solution, Rosetta 2 is a built-in translation layer that allows most Intel-based software to run efficiently on the M1 chip.

If you have specific plugins or additional software needs, I recommend checking Adobe's website or other related forums for the latest updates on compatibility.

Should you have further questions or need assistance with your purchase, please feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

Tech Online Store Support Team
