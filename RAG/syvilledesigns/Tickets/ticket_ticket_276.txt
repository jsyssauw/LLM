I am reaching out to inquire about guidance-related services for setting up a reliable ticket system and optimizing our existing server administration processes. We are currently utilizing your IT Consulting Service but have encountered some challenges in fully leveraging its benefits to enhance our operational efficiency. Our organization, led by <name>, has been actively seeking ways to streamline the management of IT requests and improve the overall performance of our server infrastructure.
