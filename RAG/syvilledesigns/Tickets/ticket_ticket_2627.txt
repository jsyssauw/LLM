Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to bring to your immediate attention a pressing issue concerning a billing error that I have encountered. I recently received an invoice related to the IT Consulting Service provided by your firm for my company's account, and there appears to be an overcharge that needs urgent resolution.

The invoice in question was issued on October 10th, under account number <acc_num>. Upon reviewing the invoice details, I've noticed discrepancies that suggest an overcharge for the consulting services provided. The billed amount significantly exceeds the agreed-upon rates as outlined in our initial contract and discussions with your sales team.

Given the urgency of resolving this financial error, I would appreciate it if you could prioritize this matter and assist me in clarifying and correcting the invoice. It is crucial for us to ensure that our records are accurate and reflect the agreed terms of our engagement.

To proceed, please let me know if you require further details or documentation from my side to expedite the review process. Additionally, I would be grateful if you could provide a timeline for rectifying the invoice and issuing the correct statement at your earliest convenience.

I trust that we can resolve this matter promptly and maintain our positive business relationship moving forward. Thank you for your attention to this urgent billing inquiry. Should you need to discuss this over the phone, please feel free to contact me directly at <tel_num>.

Looking forward to your swift response.
