Subject: Faulty Canon PIXMA MG3620 Wireless Connection
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Support,

I recently purchased a Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer from your store, but unfortunately, I have encountered an issue with its wireless connection. The printer frequently disconnects from the Wi-Fi, making it impossible to use. I have tried multiple troubleshooting steps but to no avail. Could you please assist me in processing a replacement or exchange unit?
