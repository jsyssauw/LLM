Subject: Request for Refund Due to Incorrect Billing
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Hello,

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I'm reaching out to discuss a matter concerning the recent renewal of my Adobe Photoshop 2024 subscription through your online store. After examining my billing statement, I realized there are extra charges beyond the regular renewal price.

My account number is <acc_num>, and the transaction took place on <date>. The original fee was supposed to be consistent with previous annual charges, but there appears to be an inconsistency with added fees. As a result of these unexpected costs, I request a prompt assessment of my account and a refund for any mistakenly billed amounts.

Customer satisfaction is paramount, and timely resolution of this issue will help to restore my confidence in your services. Kindly inform me of the steps I should take or if additional information is needed from my side. You can reach me via email or on my phone at <tel_num> for any further discussions.

Thank you for prioritizing this matter. I am eager for your swift response and remedy.

Warm regards,

<name>
