Subject: Request for Exchange: Printer Issues
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support Team, 

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to express my dissatisfaction with a recent purchase from your store. I bought a Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer, and since then, I have been experiencing recurring wireless connectivity issues and frequent error messages during printing.

Each time I attempt to print wirelessly, the connection drops unexpectedly, which results in incomplete tasks. Moreover, the printer frequently displays various error messages that interrupt the printing process, making it exceedingly frustrating to complete any work.

Given these persistent problems, I am requesting an exchange for this unit. I have already tried all the troubleshooting steps recommended in the manual, but unfortunately, the issues remain unresolved.

Could you please advise on the next steps and how I can proceed with exchanging this product? I am hopeful that this matter can be resolved promptly. 

Thank you for your understanding and prompt attention to this issue. I look forward to your expedited response. 

Best regards,
