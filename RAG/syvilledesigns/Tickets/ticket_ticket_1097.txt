Subject: Flickering Screen Issue on Samsung QLED TV
Incident Type: Incident
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am reaching out to report an issue with my recently purchased Samsung QLED QN90A TV, model: Quantum Dot, Smart TV, HDR, 4K. The screen occasionally flickers when switching channels or apps. The interruption lasts only a few seconds, but it's frequent enough to be disruptive to the viewing experience. I have already tried restarting the TV and ensuring that all cables are securely connected, but the issue persists.

Please advise on how to resolve this problem. Is there a firmware update or a setting adjustment that could address the flickering screen? If it's beyond a do-it-yourself fix, I would appreciate any guidance on repair services available for products still within warranty.

Looking forward to your swift response.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the flickering issue with your Samsung QLED QN90A TV. We're sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.

To resolve this issue, please check if there is a firmware update available for your TV by navigating to the settings menu and selecting "Support" followed by "Software Update." This can often address common issues like flickering.

If the problem persists after ensuring your firmware is up-to-date, try adjusting the "Picture Mode" settings or resetting them to factory defaults, which can sometimes resolve visual disruptions.

Should these steps not fix the issue, your TV might require professional support. As you've mentioned the TV is still within warranty, we recommend contacting our authorized repair services for further assistance. Please reach out to our service center at <tel_num> or through your account portal <acc_num>.

We are here to help, and we aim to resolve this for you as swiftly as possible.

Best regards,
