Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I am reaching out to inform you about a problem with my Dell XPS 13 9310, which is experiencing occasional screen flickering. This Windows 10 ultrabook has been dependable until recently, but the flickering now disrupts my productivity. I have already taken basic troubleshooting steps, including updating drivers and verifying that the system software is up to date. Despite these efforts, the issue remains unresolved. Could you kindly provide some guidance or possible solutions for this problem? Your support in tackling this issue would be immensely valued.

Thank you for addressing this matter.

Kind regards,

Customer Service answer: Dear <name>,

Thank you for contacting us. Concerning the intermittent screen flickering on your Dell XPS 13, please consider the following steps:

1. **Booting in Safe Mode**: Assess if the flickering occurs in Safe Mode. If it doesnâ€™t, this could indicate a software conflict.
2. **Disabling Hardware Acceleration**: Turn off hardware acceleration in your display settings, as this issue can sometimes lead to flickering.
3. **Testing with an External Monitor**: Attach to an external monitor to determine if flickering happens there as well. This may help clarify if the problem lies with the screen or the GPU.
4. **Closing Background Applications**: Shut down any unnecessary background programs that might affect display rendering.

If these steps do not resolve the problem, a professional evaluation or repair may be necessary. Please let us know if you require any further help or if you wish to look into repair possibilities.

Best regards,

Customer Support Team
