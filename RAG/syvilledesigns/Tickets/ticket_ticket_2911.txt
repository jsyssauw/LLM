Hello <name>,

Thank you for reaching out. To resolve debugging errors and extension compatibility issues in Visual Studio Code 1.70, try the following steps: 

1. Update Visual Studio Code to the latest version as updates might contain fixes for these issues.
2. Check for updates for your extensions. You can do this by going to the Extensions view and applying any pending updates.
3. Look for any deprecation or migration notices in the extension documentation that might affect compatibility with Visual Studio Code 1.70.
4. If problems persist, run Visual Studio Code without extensions using the command line option: `code --disable-extensions` to identify problematic ones.

If these steps do not resolve the issues, please provide more details or refer to the official Visual Studio Code support resources.

Best regards,
Customer Support
