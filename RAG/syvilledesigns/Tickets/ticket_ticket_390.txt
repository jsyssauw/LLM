Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Tech Online Store Customer Support,

I am experiencing ongoing wireless connectivity issues with my Canon PIXMA MG3620 printer. These problems are preventing successful duplex printing and mobile printing operations. This functionality was one of the key reasons I purchased this model, and its absence is seriously affecting usability. Could you please advise on possible troubleshooting steps or solutions? Any assistance in resolving this issue through possible update recommendations or network settings adjustments would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Dear <name>,

Thank you for reaching out regarding your Canon PIXMA MG3620 connectivity issue. Here are a few troubleshooting steps to resolve your wireless, duplex, and mobile printing problems:

1. **Restart Devices**: Turn off your printer and wireless router for a few minutes, then turn them back on.
