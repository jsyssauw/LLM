Subject: Issue with Canon PIXMA MG3620 Duplex Printing
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Hello, 

I am reaching out to report an issue with my Canon PIXMA MG3620 purchased from Tech Online Store. The main problem I am encountering is that the printer fails to initiate duplex printing, despite diligently following all troubleshooting steps provided in the user manual. I have performed multiple factory reset attempts, hoping to resolve this issue on my own, but regrettably, to no avail. 

The printer, despite being relatively new, does not seem to enter the duplex mode even when I select the double-sided printing option. I have also ensured that the printer drivers are up-to-date and have reinstalled them as a measure of caution. I would appreciate if your team could provide further guidance or suggest any additional steps I might have overlooked to address this problem effectively. If you require any specific details in order to assist me better, please let me know. 

Thank you for your timely support. I am looking forward to your response at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,

Customer Service answer: Hello,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the issue with your Canon PIXMA MG3620's duplex printing. We understand how frustrating this can be, and we're here to help.

Since you’ve already updated the drivers and conducted a factory reset, let's try checking a couple of additional things:

1. Verify the paper size and type settings in the printer settings to ensure they match the paper loaded for duplex printing.
2. Make sure the option for "automatic duplexing" is enabled in your print settings.
3. If you're printing from a networked device, ensure that the network is stable as disruptions can affect printer communication.
4. Check for any firmware updates via Canon's official website that might address this functionality.

If the problem persists, it might be beneficial to test the printer on another device to rule out software conflicts. Additionally, consulting with Canon’s direct support might provide specific solutions.

Feel free to reach out if you need further assistance. We’re here to ensure your printer functions smoothly.

Best wishes,

Service Desk Team
