Subject: Sluggish Boot Issue
Incident Type: Problem
Customer Issue: Dear Customer Support,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express a concern regarding my recent purchase of a Dell XPS 13 9310 from your Tech Online Store. Since I started using it last month, I have been facing consistent issues during boot up. It takes an unusually long time to fully start up, which is affecting my daily work routine significantly.

Given that this laptop is essential for my job, its performance issues are impacting my productivity. The sluggish boot up means I spend considerable time waiting for it to be ready, which is disruptive, especially at the start of busy workdays.

I have tried several methods to resolve this issue on my own, including clearing the startup programs and ensuring all drivers are up to date, but unfortunately, the problem persists. 

I kindly request your assistance in troubleshooting this problem or possibly exploring other avenues to achieve a faster boot time. Please let me know the next steps I should take, or if there's a support specialist I could speak to directly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your prompt response to hopefully resolve this issue swiftly.

Best regards,
<name>
