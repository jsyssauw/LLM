Subject: Question About Returning a Recently Made Purchase
Incident Type: Request
Customer Issue: Hello Customer Support,

I trust this note finds you well. Last week, I bought a MacBook Air M1 from your online shop, with the order number <order_num>. Unfortunately, due to unexpected circumstances, I am considering returning the item. Could you please share detailed information about your return policy for unopened products like this? I want to ensure I fully comprehend the terms and any possible restocking fees involved.

Thank you in advance for your help. I eagerly await your response.

Best wishes,
